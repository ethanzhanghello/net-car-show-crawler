      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Focus Electric is Ford’s first consumer-oriented battery-electric vehicle, based on the redesigned 2012 Ford Focus compact hatchback. Ford says the car’s range will be “up to 100 miles,” but the EPA hasn’t rated the car yet. Nissan made the same claim for its Leaf electric car, whose range is EPA-rated at 73 miles.\n\nAs a battery-electric car with no gas backup, the Focus Electric’s direct competitors are the Leaf and the Mitsubishi i-MiEV. Like Nissan, which has contracted AeroVironment to assess and install charging setups at buyers’ homes, Ford will be working with Best Buy and its Geek Squad tech-support operation to manage third-party electrical contractors.\n\nFord estimates that a depleted Focus Electric battery pack will recharge in as little as three to four hours using a 240-volt home charging station, roughly twice as fast as the Leaf.\n\nPricing hasn’t been announced, but the Focus Electric should be eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit. It will begin delivery late in 2011 in select markets: Boston; Chicago; Denver; Detroit; Los Angeles; San Francisco; San Diego; Seattle; New York; Washington, D.C.; Orlando, Fla.; Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Houston; Phoenix; Tucson, Ariz.; Portland, Ore.; Raleigh/Durham, N.C.; and Richmond, Va.\n\nExterior\nThe Focus Electric shares the overall shape of the Focus hatchback, but it has a few distinguishing elements. A dead giveaway is the charging port — which is surrounded by an LED display that indicates charge status while the car is plugged in — on the driver-side front fender. There are modest “Electric” badges all around.\n\nThe Focus Electric features a modified but still prominent grille — ironic because the electric car has less cooling demands than internal-combustion engines. The nose is otherwise smoother and is free of fog lights to improve aerodynamics. LED running lights adorn the headlight clusters. The wheels are distinctive 17-inch alloys with Michelin Energy Saver low-rolling-resistance tires.\n\nInterior\nThe Focus Electric accommodates up to five occupants in standard cloth seats. The folding backseat is split 60/40 like the higher gas-powered trim levels. (Lower trims have a single-piece folding bench.) Other standard features include push-button start, a touch-screen navigation system and Sony nine-speaker stereo with Sirius Satellite Radio.\n\nTwin LCD screens flank the speedometer, with a battery-charge display in place of a fuel gauge. The gauges can be configured to show charge range versus the anticipated distance of your trip, and they can also display a diagram to show the range situation at a glance. Bluish butterflies populate or disappear to indicate how efficiently you’re driving and how much battery range you have versus your intended trip.\n\nWith a feature similar to those on the Leaf and Chevrolet Volt, owners can preheat or precool the cabin on grid power with the charging cable. This preserves the battery charge for miles of range once the car is unplugged and driven. (Heat and air conditioning use electric power, decreasing range.) The feature can be scheduled ahead of time or activated remotely using a MyFord Touch owner website or smartphone app.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Focus Electric uses a 23-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack that’s heated and cooled by liquid to maximize range and life expectancy. An electric motor or motors (yet to be announced) drive the front wheels to a top speed of 84 mph.\n\nA 6.6-kilowatt onboard charger works with the 240-volt charging station to fill the battery pack in half the time required by the Leaf, according to Ford. (The Leaf’s onboard charger has lower capacity and thus charges more slowly.) A 120-volt cord for charging from a common household outlet is included, but it takes at least three times as long as the 240-volt system. Ford estimates the charging station hardware and installation will cost about $1,499, but prices vary widely.\n\nSafety\nAs required by law of all 2012 models, the Focus Electric has standard antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. Six airbags are also standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Focus Electric is Ford’s first consumer-oriented battery-electric vehicle, based on the Ford Focus compact hatchback. Ford says the car’s range will be “up to 100 miles,” but the EPA has rated the car around 76 miles per charge. Its primary competitor is the Nissan Leaf.\n\nLike Nissan, which has contracted AeroVironment to assess and install charging setups at buyers’ homes, Ford will be working with Best Buy and its Geek Squad tech-support operation to manage third-party electrical contractors.\n\nFord estimates that a depleted Focus Electric battery pack will recharge in as little as four hours using a 240-volt home charging station, roughly twice as fast as the Leaf.\nNew For 2013\nThe 2013 Focus Electric gets a new driver’s knee airbag as well as four-way adjustable front and rear head restraints.\n\nExteriorThe Focus Electric shares the overall shape of the Focus hatchback, but it has a few distinguishing elements. A dead giveaway is the charging port — which is surrounded by an LED display that indicates charge status while the car is plugged in — on the driver-side front fender. It also has a unique, prominent front grille — ironic because the electric car has less cooling demands than a car with an internal-combustion engine. The nose is otherwise smoother and free of fog lights to improve aerodynamics. Exterior features include:\n\n\nUnique 17-inch alloy wheels with low-rolling-resistance tires\nLED running lamps with high-intensity-discharge headlights\nRear spoiler\n“Electric” badges\n\nInteriorTwin LCD screens flank the speedometer, and there’s a battery-charge display in place of a fuel gauge. The screens are configurable and include a mode where bluish butterflies populate or disappear based on driving efficiency.\n\nLike in the Leaf and Chevrolet Volt, owners can preheat or precool the cabin on grid power before a trip. This helps preserve the battery’s charge when driving because less energy needs to be spent heating or cooling the interior. The feature can be scheduled ahead of time or activated remotely using a smartphone app. Interior features include:\n\n\nSeats five in standard cloth seats; leather upholstery available\nHeated front seats\n60/40-split folding backseat\nTouch-screen navigation system\nSony audio\nSync with MyFord Touch technology\nPush-button start\n\nUnder the HoodThe Focus Electric uses a 23-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack that features liquid heating and cooling to maximize range and the battery’s life expectancy. A 143-horsepower electric motor drives the front wheels to a top speed of 84 mph. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nRegenerative braking\n6.6-kilowatt onboard charger for 240-volt charging\n120-volt charging cord for common household outlets and slower charging\nSingle-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nDriver’s knee airbag",
