      "expert_review": "SAN DIEGO–The 2001 Explorer Sport Trac is great for those who like to play dirty and stay clean.\n\nPlaying dirty, as in hauling muddy mountain bikes or bags of peat moss and wood mulch, and staying clean, meaning keeping the mud and muck out of the passenger compartment.\n\nThis segment busting part-truck, part-SUV is what Ford calls an “and” vehicle (everything an SUV is “and” more). Explorer sales have grown from 250,000 in 1991 to 440,000 last year, and the Sport Trac gives them access to another group of buyers. Production at the Louisville, Ky., plant is underway and it should begin showing up in dealer showrooms this month. Prices will start at $23,050 for two-wheel drive and $25,800 for four-wheel drive.\n\nAfter a short drive in a preproduction vehicle in early December, it was easy to see that Ford has a potential hit on its hands. Powered by a 205-horsepower, 4.0-liter, overhead-cam V6 engine, it delivers a modest amount of power in a smooth, unobtrusive way. The five-speed automatic transmission is a model of civility. (A five-speed manual will be offered later in the year.)\n\nBased on its intended use mostly as a passenger car, the Sport Trac’s suspension is tuned so the ride is more supple than a small truck but firmer than a passenger car. Driving through turns on mountain roads, it was more secure and agile than the regular Explorer.\n\nThe styling is appealing in an outdoor, camping-gear sort of way that stresses function over fashion. The fact that it is capable of a wide variety of uses appeals to me most.\n\nThe Sport Trac had its genesis in the 1996 Adrenalin concept vehicle that appeared at a few auto shows, including the one in Kansas City. Public reaction to that vehicle was so positive that Ford pulled it from the show circuit in hopes that other automakers wouldn’t notice the crowds around it and try the same thing.\n\nThey were only partially successful because other companies have similar vehicles under development, but Ford can boast that it got the Sport Trac to market first.\n\nThe Sport Trac, with a wheelbase of 125.9 inches, is built on an Explorer frame that has been lengthened 14.25 inches. The frame has been stiffened for a better ride, which is now almost as supple as a passenger car.\n\nA composite cargo box, slightly more than 4 feet long, is impervious to rust, and the molded black lining resists scratches and dents from rugged loads. Tie-downs, 10 in all, are provided for securing cargo, and they are strong enough to move a refrigerator, Ford says.\n\nA lockable cargo cover is optional, as is a removable plastic divider that allows the box to be partitioned into two separate areas. Another useful option is a tubular bed extended that folds out onto an open tailgate and extends the bed’s length to 6 feet.\n\nSport Trac can haul a payload of about 1,500 pounds and tow more than 5, 000 pounds.\n\nThe cabin is basically the same size as a standard Explorer, and even though the back seat looks smaller, it has as much head, leg and shoulder room as the regular Explorer. The 60/40 rear seat can be folded down to hold large items.\n\nThe back window is a power unit, unique in this kind of application.\n\nFord designed low-back bucket seats to open up the space inside the truck and keep back-seat passengers from feeling isolated.\n\nThe instrument panel has light-faced gauges like those in a sport sedan, and a new radio that uses push buttons for tuning rather than a knob, which is more intuitive.\n\nA removable nylon sport bag sits inside the console. Fitted with a strap and side netting, it can be used to carry snacks, CDs, cell phones or even lunch.\n\nA thick rubber covering is used on the floor so it can be cleaned out easily when it gets dirty. It also cuts down on the amount of road noise that filters int the cabin. Berber carpet floor mats lend a civilized feel.\n\nCloth seats are standard, but leather is optional, and the leather option includes a rear console with separate audio and climate controls, cupholders and two headphone jacks.\n\nA small storage compartment, big enough for a camera, is behind the back seat on the driver’s side.\n\nThe back seat also has tether anchors for three child safety seats.\n\nOther items of note:\n\nAnti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nA battery saver cuts off all interior lights after 40 minutes to keep from running down the battery.\n\nNoise abatement includes laminated steel in the instrument panel, thick door seals and sound-deadening material in the door and windshield pillars.\n\nThe frame is coated with rust-resistant primer, a first for Ford.\n\nPrice\n\nBase prices range from $23,050 to $25,800.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nThere is no At a Glance box because this was a drive of a preproduction vehicle. We will review a regular production vehicle when one becomes available.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 4.0-liter, V6\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\nCONFIGURATION: Two-wheel or four-wheel drive\nWHEELBASE: 125.9 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,400 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $23,050 to $25,800\nMPG RATING: 16 city, 19 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe introduction of the new midsize four-door Explorer doesnt mean the previous model disappeared. Restyled as an early 2001 model, the two-door body style  dubbed Explorer Sport  continues in the market without significant changes for 2002. The Explorer Sport Trac also debuted in spring 2000 and is based on the earlier-generation four-door Explorer but with an open cargo bed.\n\nExterior\nThe Explorer Sport is 180.4 inches long overall with a 101.8-inch wheelbase. It measures 70.2 inches wide and 68.2 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nPassenger capacity is far smaller than that of the four-door Explorer. The two-door Sport fits only four occupants on cloth-upholstered bucket seats or captains chairs up front and a split, folding rear seat. Cargo volume is 71.4 cubic feet with the split rear seatbacks folded down for extra storage room. Leather upholstery is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe lone engine is a 203-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-6 with overhead camshafts. Either a five-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission can be installed. Explorer Sport models come with either rear-drive or Control Trac II four-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and a Reverse Sensing System that alerts the driver of nearby objects to the rear while backing up are optional.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The practical appeal of Ford’s Explorer Sport Trac was perfectly clear when I needed to haul an inflatable moonwalk for my grandson’s birthday party.\n\nPart SUV, part truck, the Sport Trac has a full-size back seat that is big enough to hold two or three people. When you need to haul something big, like a pile of canvas that puffs up to be a moonwalk, you’ve got a bed that can be expanded to be almost as large as one in a pickup.\n\nPricing starts at $22,880 for the two-wheel-drive and ranges to $31,615 for the test vehicle, which was the XLT Premium Pioneer Edition. This special model is a $1,295 addition to the premium sport group, and it included a 485-watt Pioneer stereo with custom subwoofer, rear-window deflector and aluminum wheels. The zinc yellow paint job was almost as loud as the stereo, which will pop your eardrums if you really want it to.\n\nThe 210-horsepower, 4.0-liter, overhead-cam V-6 engine delivers a modest amount of power in a smooth, unobtrusive way. The five-speed automatic transmission is a model of smooth shifting and civility. It can haul a payload of 1,500 pounds and tow 5,300 pounds. An optional V-8 would be welcome, but it is not available.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive system is electronic, and it has a low range for off-road use. A limited-slip rear axle is also available for enhanced traction. Anti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nThe 2003 model will get disc brakes on the rear wheels and, later in the year, an optional side-curtain airbag system. The Sport Trac is built on a frame that has been lengthened to have a wheelbase of 125.9 inches. The frame, used for the previous generation Explorer, was stiffened for a better ride. The Sport Trac does not have the frame or independent rear suspension of the 2002 Explorer, so its ride lacks some of the suppleness of the newer vehicle.\n\nThe Sport Trac’s composite cargo box, slightly more than 4 feet long, fits snugly up against the back of the cabin. Since it is not made from steel, it is impervious to rust, and the molded black lining resists scratches and dents from rugged loads. There are 10 tie-downs for securing cargo, and they are strong enough to move a refrigerator, Ford says.\n\nThe aluminum tubular cargo cage really extends the Sport Trac’s usefulness. It fits into the back of the bed and, when folded out onto an open tailgate, creates a cargo space that is nearly 6 feet long. With the tailgate closed, it flips into the bed and creates a barrier that corrals small objects and keeps them from sliding around. It can also be removed when necessary.\n\nInside, the Sport Trac cabin is basically a mirror image of the previous Explorer. The floor is covered with thick rubber so it can be washed out if it gets dirty. The rubber also cuts down on the amount of road noise that filters into the cabin. Carpet mats go on top of the rubber floor.\n\nLow-back front bucket seats keep rear-seat passengers from feeling claustrophobic. Although the back seat looks smal ler than a regular Explorer, Ford says it has as much head, leg and shoulder room. Cloth seats are standard, but considering how much easier it is to clean leather, I think the leather option is preferable. Besides, the leather package includes a rear console with separate audio and climate controls, cupholders and two headphone jacks. The 60/40 rear seat folds to accommodate large items, such as luggage, inside the cabin. The power rear window can be lowered for ventilation or access to the cargo box.\n\nA small storage compartment, big enough for a camera, is built into the cabin wall behind the back seat. Tether anchors for three child safety seats are also standard.\n\nThe instrument panel has light-faced gauges that are easy to read and the stereo glows blue at night. Like most new stereos, the Pioneer unit is not as simple to operate as it could be.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the test truck was $29,115. The limited-slip rear axle, Pioneer Edition equipment leather seats and cargo cage brought the sticker price to $31,615.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Sport Trac is an ideal vehicle for people with an active, outdoor lifestyle. The cabin is as nice as any SUV, while the separate cargo bed keeps dirty items separate. The optional cargo cage can extend the bed length to 6 feet.\n\nCounterpoint: A little more power would be welcome, especially when hauling a load. The Pioneer stereo sounds great but has somewhat cryptic controls.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 4.0-liter, 210-hp V-6\nTransmission: automatic Four-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 125.9 inches\nCurb weight: 4,323 lbs.\nBase price: $29,115\nAs driven: $31,615\nMpg rating: 15 city, 20 hwy.\n> >",
