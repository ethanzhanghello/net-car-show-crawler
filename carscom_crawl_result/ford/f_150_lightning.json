      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nThe 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning is a fully electrified version of America’s most popular pickup truck. Available with anywhere from 230 to 320 miles of range, the F-150 Lightning has seating for five and comes standard with all-wheel drive. Acceleration is surprisingly quick, and it’s accomplished in near silence. \n\nThere are two battery pack choices. The standard-range pack delivers 452 horsepower; the extended-range version ups that to 580 hp. The roomy cabin features a 12-inch Sync 4 infotainment system that has large graphics and is easy to use after only a few minutes of familiarization. While it’s an EV, this is still a big and heavy truck at heart; body roll and steering feel remain trucklike when driving with verve through corners. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nThe 2023 F-150 Lightning remains technically the same as the 2022 model year, yet a significant price jump means the most basic version of this electric pickup now costs approximately $58,000 — roughly $16,000 more than its original sticker price.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\n5.5-foot cargo bed\n12-inch digital instrument cluster\nHeated front seats\nVinyl seating surfaces\nDual-zone climate control\nUnderbody skid plates\nLocking rear differential\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n15.5-inch touchscreen\nWireless device charging\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nMax Trailer Tow Package\nAdaptive cruise control\n18-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system\nLeather seating\n22-inch alloy wheels\nPower-deployable running boards\nShould I Buy the 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning represents a seismic shift in the pickup truck market. While rivals are relatively scarce for the moment, competitors like the Rivian R1T and upcoming electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra will give the Lightning a run for its money — and while we’re speaking of money, the escalating price of the Lightning could make it a harder sell compared with the regular F-150 lineup. But for truck buyers who can adapt to the EV lifestyle (and who appreciate very quick acceleration), the Lightning is the complete package.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The F-150 Lightning makes the most out of an all-electric truck by combining impressive power and useful innovations with many of the characteristics that make the F-150 the bestselling vehicle in North America.\nVersus the competition: The F-150 Lightning doesn’t have much competition now, but more is coming; its more traditional interior and exterior styling may make it more appealing than futuristic offerings from competitors.\nDescribing the all-new 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning as “the F-150, but electric” feels like a disservice, but after getting a chance to drive the Lightning in San Antonio, that observation rings mostly true (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our flights and lodging at these events).\nRelated: ​​Up Close With the 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning: Substance Over Style\nThe F-150 Lightning is currently available in four trim levels: Pro, XLT, Lariat and Platinum. All come with standard four-wheel drive and dual electric motors, and there are two battery choices: standard- (in Pro, XLT and Lariat) and extended-range (XLT, Lariat and Platinum). Standard-range models are EPA-rated at 230 miles of range, while the extended-range XLT and Lariat are rated at 320 miles. The loaded, extended-range-only Platinum has a rating of 300 miles.\nI spent most of my time in an extended-range Lightning Lariat — which has an eye-watering $81,099 price tag (all prices include destination) — while also towing an 8,300-pound boat and trailer combination in an extended-range XLT. I came away quite impressed with the Lightning, though there are some large caveats that will require further testing before I can give it a full-throated recommendation.\nNot So Different\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Ford F-150 Lightning | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n  \n\n  \n    That the Lightning is so similar to the internal-combustion F-150 is, at least in my book, a huge point in its favor. After all, the redesigned 2021 F-150 swept both our Best Pickup Truck and Best of 2021 awards, and we still have an F-150 Limited hybrid in our long-term test fleet. Besides some new tech, which I’ll address in a moment, the Lightning should feel extremely familiar to those who have driven any of the last few generations of F-150.\nIt will also look quite familiar, with some new lighting designs that stretch from headlight to headlight and taillight to taillight (except on the Pro) and Lightning-specific badging and wheel designs. It’s a different tactic than the upcoming 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, which might not share more than a similar-looking body panel or two with the existing Silverado, and perhaps the upcoming electric pickup from Ram. I think sticking to the familiar shape and design language of the F-150 may make it more appealing to traditional truck buyers but likely comes at the cost of some efficiency.\nThat familiarity extends to much of the Lightning’s driving experience, too. Ride quality feels like driving a regular F-150 with a decent-sized payload in the bed; still trucklike and bouncy but more settled than an unladen F-150. The Lightning uses an independent rear suspension, a first for any F-150, but in my relatively short drive it was difficult to attribute any improved ride quality to the new suspension layout alone. The Lariat I drove the most also wore 20-inch wheels, and Cars.com’s F-150 Limited rides on unnecessarily large 22s — another factor in the improved isolation and reduced impact harshness I experienced compared with our truck.\nI expected handling to be improved with the new suspension setup and much lower center of gravity thanks to the Lightning’s battery packs, and while it may be a little improved, it still handles like an F-150 — i.e., not that great. There’s still a lot of body roll in sharp corners, though the Lightning never leaned then slammed back to level like our long-term F-150 tends to do in sharp, low-speed corners. Steering feel also tends towards the vague, trucklike end of the spectrum; absolutely appropriate for a truck but not for spirited driving. While the Lightning feels like it could be a great platform for a street-oriented sport truck from the factory, what you can buy right now won’t be right out of the box.\nLightning Quick\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Ford F-150 Lightning | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n  \n\n  \n    A point in favor of the Lightning feeling like it could be a great street sport truck is that, in the extended-range versions I drove, it is quick. We’ve measured our F-150 Limited hybrid’s 0-60 mph acceleration in 5.74 seconds, and Ford estimates that standard-range Lightning models will have a 0-60 time in the 5-second range, while the extended-range will drop that to the “mid-4-second” realm. It doesn’t seem like they’re wrong, either. Stomp on the accelerator and 775 pounds-feet of instantly accessible torque will push you back into your seat. Just as important, there are gobs of power immediately available at higher speeds for merging and passing.\nWhere the Lightning’s performance was a letdown in my driving experience is in the communication from its pedals. Both the brake and accelerator pedals provide a less-than-intuitive feeling that makes modulation more difficult. There’s lots of braking power, but it was hard to find a way to access it without lots of abrupt stops. Throttle modulation wasn’t as easy as I would’ve hoped, either, and with one-pedal driving (a feature that applies braking force as you ease off the accelerator) turned on, it was even more difficult. One-pedal driving in the Lightning has lots of bite and no adjustability, and in my driving time I couldn’t quite get the feel for operating it smoothly. I think more time behind the wheel would give me that, but it’s a steeper learning curve than I’ve experienced in other electric vehicles\nTowing a Breeze, But There’s a Catch\nPulling 8,300 pounds’ worth of boat and trailer behind a Lightning XLT with the extended-range battery wasn’t effortless — it’s 8,300 pounds — but it didn’t seem to trouble the powertrain. Range was significantly impacted, but Ford claims that impact is not unlike what happens to a gas-powered truck when towing. It’s hard to accurately gauge just how range was affected after a quick driving loop. At about half battery charge, the range estimate was roughly 80 miles, but the truck had also been left idling to keep it from becoming uncomfortable in the Texas heat. The Lightning uses Ford’s available Onboard Scales feature to estimate trailer or payload weight, which is used as a data point to update the range prediction while towing or hauling. For now, let’s just be clear that the available range is much less when towing heavy loads.\nHere’s the thing: Despite an unclear picture of the precise impact towing has on the Lightning’s range, for those towing long distances, this is probably not the truck for you. If a full charge is giving you under 200 miles of range to start, you’ll probably need to charge often. That means many stops, taking longer than it would take to fill up a fuel tank or tanks. And, now, charging stations aren’t really designed for long vehicle and trailer combos the way many off-highway gas stations and truck stops are, so charging likely means decoupling the trailer from the truck. If you’re just, say, pulling a heavy trailer around town for business and charging at home or at a fleet garage, the Lightning may still have what you’re looking for.\nThe Lightning also can be equipped with all the towing aids of the regular F-150, including Ford’s Smart Hitch technology, Pro Trailer Backup Assist and much more. Its maximum towing capacity is 10,000 pounds, and there’s a Max Towing Package (just like a regular F-150) that adds things like an additional battery chiller to reduce the likelihood of overheating.\nThe F-150 Interior of the Very Near Future\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Like the exterior, the interior of the Lightning should be very familiar to those with time in internal-combustion F-150s. In lower Lightning trims with the landscape-oriented 12-inch Sync 4 touchscreen display, the control layout is nearly identical to that of current high-level internal-combustion F-150s. It’s easy to use and my preferred configuration.\nLariat and Platinum Lightnings get Ford’s latest Sync 4A system with a portrait-oriented 15.5-inch touchscreen. This replaces nearly every physical control with a touchscreen one, which can be aggravating for adjusting things like climate settings. Sync 4A doesn’t have a significant learning curve, but settings that could and probably should be single, physical buttons (heated and ventilated seats, one-pedal driving) can be located sometimes multiple menus deep. It’s unnecessarily complex, and I’ll be sad when it makes its way into more Ford products; the Expedition and Edge SUVs, along with the Mustang Mach-E, already have it available. That likely means it’s coming for the F-150.\nFront and rear seating remains excellent. Ford says the Lightning has the same interior measurements as the internal-combustion F-150, which means plenty of passenger room. My knees are slightly raised in the backseat, which can be uncomfortable on longer trips, but there’s plenty of legroom to stretch and spread out. Materials quality in the Lightning models I drove felt comparable to the F-150, meaning that it feels somewhat upscale but still below the standard set by the luxurious Ram 1500.\nSomething that makes the F-150 Lightning a unique Ford pickup is its Mega Power Frunk, a front trunk that’s as useful as it is terribly named. There are additional power outlets and drain plugs inside, and it’s roomy enough for multiple bags (it also counts towards the Lightning’s payload capacity, which maxes out at 2,235 pounds). We’ve praised the frunk already, but this analysis feels far more accurate than talking about how many bags the Lightning can carry up front.\nFree of Charging, for Now\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Ford F-150 Lightning | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n  \n\n  \n    The biggest issue with reviewing an EV at an event like this is the inability to get a good sense of the charging experience. I never got a chance to plug it in.\nFord’s charging claims for the Lightning aren’t unimpressive, but they will likely lag competitors. The standard-range battery has a maximum 11.3-kilowatt onboard AC charger, and the extended range battery has a 19.2-kW onboard AC charger. Using the included Mobile Power Cord and Level 2 charging at 30 amps, standard- and extended-range Lightnings add approximately 13 miles of range per hour (12 for the Platinum). Upgrade to Ford’s 48-amp Level 2 wall charging station, and those numbers jump to 19 and 20, respectively. For comparison, a Rivian R1T can replenish its battery at a faster rate of 25 miles of range per hour at 11.5 kW when charging at 48 amps, according to Rivian.\nThe second charging station, Ford’s 80-amp Charge Station Pro, unlocks the full home charging potential of the extended battery’s 19.2-kW dual onboard chargers that add 30 miles per hour to extended-range trucks.\nThe Lightning can also take advantage of 150-kW DC fast charging, adding an estimated 41 or 54 miles in 10 minutes and going from 15% to 80% charge in as little as 41 minutes. Keep in mind that there are many factors — weather, battery temperature and charging station power delivery — that can affect these numbers, none of which we were able to verify. We’d like to get a Lightning in for a more thorough test as soon as we can.\nA potential shortcoming for the Lightning is its charging abilities relative to competitors. The Rivian R1T can currently fast-charge at around 200 kW, and both the GMC Hummer EV Pickup and the upcoming Chevrolet Silverado EV should be able to take advantage of 350-kW fast charging. That disparity is mitigated somewhat by the current dearth of 350-kW charging stations, but more should be coming online in the future as more vehicles with that capability hit the market. Given that having Level 2 home charging should be part of your ownership experience of the Lightning (or any EV), the lower fast-charging rate becomes less important. There’s no denying, however, that the Lightning’s charging abilities trail the competition.\nWe also didn’t get a chance to test one of the Lightning’s coolest features: Intelligent Backup Power. When combined with the Charge Station Pro and additional equipment installed in partnership with Sunrun, a solar energy company, Ford says the Lightning can function as de facto backup power, powering a home when traditional power sources are out. You can read all the details here, but this is an even harder feature to test. We don’t and likely won’t have the Charge Station Pro in our hands, and we really don’t want to cause a power outage.\nWith our existing familiarity with the Pro Power Onboard generator system, I didn’t focus on that during my time with the Lightning, but it’s worth noting that the Lightning’s Pro Power Onboard is the most powerful Ford has yet offered, at 9.6 kW available via 10 120-volt outlets and one 240-volt outlet. Our hybrid F-150’s 7.2-kW system was previously the most powerful you could get.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Surpasses Goals With 320-Mile Maximum Range\nHow the 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Can Power Your Home for Days\nFord Amps Up F-150 Lightning Production to Meet Demand\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\n\nWhat About Blue Cruise?\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Ford F-150 Lightning | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n  \n\n  \n    Both the Lightning Lariat and Platinum can be equipped with Blue Cruise (it’s standard on the Platinum), Ford’s hands-free semi-autonomous driving system. Like GM’s Super Cruise, Blue Cruise is available on premapped stretches of highway. It worked moderately well when I used it, though it did turn off — with ample warning to take the wheel — quickly when lane markings became a bit vague. I really don’t enjoy hands-free driving systems because I don’t like ceding that much control to a vehicle and, like Ricky Bobby, don’t know what to do with my hands while the systems are active, but it’s available if you want it.\nIs the Lightning Worth It?\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Ford F-150 Lightning | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n  \n\n  \n    If you don’t already have a reservation, getting a Lightning will be difficult. Ford significantly ramped up production to meet demand, but supply chain issues are still very much a problem, and unclaimed trucks will likely be sold at a premium.\nThat premium may give buyers pause; the Lightning can be expensive. Before the available tax credits, up to $7,500, a Pro starts at around $40,000, but the Platinum is over $90,000. The extended-range XLT I drove for towing was priced at $76,384. Before other options, a gas-powered crew-cab F-150 XLT 4×4 costs just under $50,000. There’s a significant premium to pay to make your F-150 all-electric.\nDespite some slight exterior design differences, the Lightning still very much looks like an F-150, and it drives like an F-150 with one notable exception — its prodigious, push-you-into-your-seat acceleration. That quickness may be what makes the Lightning appealing, or things like the peace of mind of Intelligent Backup Power. If having the fastest-charging EV pickup isn’t your top priority, and you’re not planning to tow or haul long distances, I think the Lightning is worth your consideration, despite its hefty price premium.\nRelated video:\n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning is an all-electric version of the hugely popular F-150 full-size pickup truck. It comes solely as a five-seat crew-cab truck with standard all-wheel drive. Two battery packs are available, and driving range falls between 240 and 320 miles per charge, depending on trim and powertrain. A 12-inch infotainment touchscreen dominates the dashboard, with an even larger 15.5-inch touchscreen optional. F-150 Lightning rivals include the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, GMC Hummer EV Pickup, Rivian R1T and Tesla Cybertruck.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nThe F-150 Lightning sees no significant changes for 2025.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Have?\n\nThe F-150 Lightning’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 240 to 320 miles, depending on battery pack and trim.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Charge the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nWith its available extended-range battery pack, the F-150 Lightning’s charging time starts at an estimated 13 hours on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger (to go from a 15% charge to an 80% charge), down to an estimated 38 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger (to go from a 15% charge to 80%). With the standard battery pack, estimated charge times are 10 hours on a Level 2 charger and 32 minutes on a DC fast charger.\n\nWhat is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nThe F-150 Lightning’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 7,700 to 10,000 pounds, depending on battery pack and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Weigh?\n\nThe F-150 Lightning’s curb weight ranges from 6,015 to 6,893 pounds, depending on trim and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\n5.5-foot cargo bed\n12-inch digital instrument cluster\nHeated front seats\nVinyl seating surfaces\nDual-zone climate control\nUnderbody skid plates\nLocking rear differential\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n15.5-inch touchscreen\nWireless device charging\nBlueCruise 1.2 hands-free highway driving assist\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nMax Trailer Tow Package\nAdaptive cruise control\n18-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system\nLeather seating\n22-inch alloy wheels\nPower-deployable running boards\nShould I Buy the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning?\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning is a compelling choice for truck shoppers who want to unplug themselves from hefty fuel bills. Quick acceleration and a near-silent ride make the Lightning a calming place to spend time. There’s plenty of room no matter where you’re seated, and the giant front trunk has 14.1 cubic feet of storage space. Keep in mind, though, that heavy towing and hauling tasks will cause driving range to plummet, and the steep price of the Lightning could make many truck shoppers reconsider the idea of going fully electric.",

      "expert_review": "What a difference a couple of years makes. The Ford F-150 Lightning debuted for the 2022 model year as the first regular-production, all-electric pickup truck from a mainstream manufacturer. When it first went on sale, the Lightning’s only electric pickup competitor was the Rivian R1T, which beat it to market by about six months. Now it has more rivals, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC’s Hummer EV Pickup and Sierra EV. We’ve tested those rival pickups, and while they all have strong points, the Lightning still stacks up well against them despite not having seen any major changes since its debut.\n\nWe’re still waiting for the 2025 Ram 1500 REV electric pickup; it was originally slated to hit dealerships in the fourth quarter of 2024, but Stellantis recently announced it won’t launch until the first half of 2025.\n\nRelated: 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning Gets New Flash Trim Level, Starts at $52,090\n\nIt’s no secret that the market for all-electric vehicles, including pickups, is uncertain at the moment, as consumer demand has been less than expected. The Lightning’s pricing has reflected this uncertainty, with Ford changing it multiple times for 2024 alone. The most recent redo brought significant price cuts for all but the line-topping Platinum trim.\n\nHere in a Flash\n\nFord cooked up a new Lightning trim level for 2024, the Flash, that seems intended to allow buyers to take advantage of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs. The Flash bundles several of the Lightning’s desirable available features — including a 131-kilowatt-hour extended-range battery, a 15.5-inch infotainment touchscreen (instead of the base 12-inch touchscreen), a wireless charging pad, an eight-speaker B&O audio system and a heated steering wheel — at a starting price $9,000 below the Lightning’s penultimate Lariat trim (which the Flash slots beneath).\n\nWe’ve already evaluated the Lightning in multiple ways beyond our original review, including testing its towing and fast-charging capabilities and seeing how its cargo bed compares with its rivals. Those impressions hold true for 2024 (and for next year given the 2025 Lightning receives no significant changes), and here we’ll add some quick impressions of the new 2024 F-150 Lightning Flash.\n\nConventionality Is a Plus\n\nOne of the F-150 Lightning’s biggest strengths is simply that it’s an F-150. The automaker’s F-Series trucks have been America’s bestselling vehicle for more than 40 years, and Ford saw no need to reinvent the wheel to make an electric version of the F-150. All of the Lightning’s rivals veer at least a little from conventional controls and pickup truck design — and the Tesla Cybertruck veers a lot — but the Lightning shares most of its design with the standard F-150. It’s easy to acclimate to this truck, especially if you’re already familiar with the conventional F-150. The Lightning also offers standout F-150 features like Ford’s BlueCruise hands-free driving system, an onboard scale function and an EV version of the Pro Power Onboard integrated generator.\n\nIn terms of both price and equipment, the Flash trim hits a sweet spot in the F-150 Lightning lineup. It starts at $70,090 (including a $2,095 destination fee), so even with a few options, the sticker price will almost certainly fall under the $80,000 retail price cap that makes domestically produced EVs eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Our test vehicle was equipped with Ford’s 9.6-kilowatt Pro Power Onboard generator ($1,200), BlueCruise with a three-year subscription ($2,100), Max Trailer Tow Package ($1,100), spray-in bedliner ($595) and a couple of other options, and its as-tested price was $75,745.\n\nHonest Cabin\n\nThe Flash’s interior isn’t quite as, uh, flashy as higher F-150 trim levels. At first blush, the ambiance — fabric seats and all — is underwhelming for a vehicle that costs more than $70K, but the more time I spent in it, the more I liked it. It’s a pleasant, honest pickup truck cabin, and I suspect its more utilitarian materials will hold up better over time than the posher trimmings of our long-term 2021 F-150 Limited did. \n\nThe Lightning inherits lots of good things from the regular F-150, but also some annoyances. I find the F-150’s oversize gearshift lever awkward to use; it’s too large to grip easily, and the button is oddly placed at the front of the shifter. The Lightning’s big, vertically oriented infotainment screen is slick for the most part, but it absorbs most of the climate controls, and screen-based buttons are less ideal than traditional hard buttons and knobs. Changing the fan speed or turning on the air recirculation is a multistep process that’s more tedious than using a simple physical control would be. The exterior touch-sensitive lock buttons on the front door handles almost never worked for me on the first try, and while the doors will lock automatically when you walk away from the vehicle with the key fob, I’m old-fashioned and prefer to do it myself. \n\nSmooth, Strong, Silent\n\nWhen equipped with the extended-range battery, the Lightning’s horsepower rating rises from an already-impressive 452 to 580 hp; its torque rating — 775 pounds-feet — is the same whether you get the standard- or extended-range battery. In our acceleration testing, a 2022 Lightning Lariat, which has the same powertrain as the Flash, accelerated from 0-60 mph in just 4.19 seconds. With 1,220 pounds of sandbags in the bed, it did the run in 4.79 seconds. That’s really moving, especially for a full-size pickup that weighs almost 7,000 pounds.\n\nIn addition to being quick, the Lightning is smooth and exceptionally quiet. Its electric powertrain has no gears to shift, and conventional engine noises are absent. Its smooth accelerator- and brake-pedal responses make the Lightning very pleasant to drive and help its close-quarters maneuverability. In general, the Lightning rides and handles well for a full-size pickup, but you still feel its substantial heft in corners even with the bulk of its weight sitting low in the chassis.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nFord Launches EV Routing With Google Maps for Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning Owners\nFord Power Promise: Free Home Charger for EV Buyers\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Ford F-150?\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nShop for a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning Near You\nDownsides and Conclusion\n\nEV powertrains offer a lot of advantages, but they also have a couple of significant drawbacks, and the Lightning doesn’t sidestep those. Its extended-range battery gives this truck a generous 320 miles of range, but that number can drop by about half when towing, as we found in our testing. (Note that it’s not unusual for conventionally powered pickups to be similarly affected when towing.) To go from a 15% to 80% battery charge can take about 40 minutes on a DC fast charger in good conditions, which is not the fastest. \n\nAn EV’s price premium is still a detriment, as well. Even though Ford has dropped the Lightning’s price over the course of the 2024 model year, it still costs quite a bit more than a comparable gas-engine F-150 — more than $10,000 more. \n\nThose problems, however, are essentially the same for any of the Lightning’s newer competitors, so if you’re in the market for an EV pickup, the Lightning is absolutely worth a test drive. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
