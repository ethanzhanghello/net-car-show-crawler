      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Ford Explorer?\n\nThe Ford Explorer is a three-row SUV with room for six or seven people, depending on the seating configuration, and is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The base engine is a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder, and an available turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 makes 365 or 400 hp. Both engines work with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid drivetrain rated at 318 total hp is also available. Competitors include the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Kia Telluride.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Ford Explorer?\n\nA new ST-Line trim level features design cues from the performance-oriented ST model, but it’s powered by the Explorer’s base four-cylinder engine rather than the V-6. ST-Line features include 20-inch aluminum wheels, quad exhaust tips, a sport steering wheel, red accent stitching, ST-Line scuff plates and a Bang & Olufsen stereo. The ST trim is now available with rear-wheel drive in addition to four-wheel drive. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Ford Explorer Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nPower liftgate\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after free trial)\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 21-inch aluminum wheels\nPanoramic moonroof \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nPower-folding third-row seat\nSecond-row sunshades\nDigital instrument panel\n10.1-inch vertically oriented dashboard touchscreen\n360-degree camera system\nNavigation\nB&O premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLane-centering steering assist\nFront parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2022 Ford Explorer?\n\nThe Explorer offers a wide range of trim levels to appeal to different buyers: We like the performance its gas engines offer, its standard touchscreen multimedia system is intuitive, and the cabin has good storage space. Seat comfort, however, isn’t great, and the third row is small.",
