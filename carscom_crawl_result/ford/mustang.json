      "expert_review": "THIS IS a story about black and white. But it has nothing to dowith race. It is about two convertibles — a black 1996 Chevrolet CamaroZ28 and a white 1995 Ford Mustang GT.\n\nIn most respects, both were created equal. But only one could winmy heart — the one that provided the most affirmative action on theroad.\n\nIt is understandable that some might find the comparison unfair.The Mustang, after all, belonged to a fading model year. And Ford haspromised that the 1996 Mustang GT convertible will be improvedsubstantially.\n\nBut the 1996 GT convertible wasn’t available. I took what was inFord’s garage.\n\nSurely, the Camaro Z28 had certain advantages — a more powerfulengine and a definite, no-compromise, in-your-face,knock-you-‘cross-the-head, urban attitude.\n\nBy comparison, the Mustang came across as a suburbanite on anexotic excursion to the inner city — quite acceptable, but somewhatclueless.\n\nThose differences notwithstanding, I used the RepublicanCongressional Standard of Evaluation in choosing my favorite of the twoconvertibles. Those standards are color-blind, unaffected by culturalnuance and personal bias, and are based solely on merit.\n\nBackground: Both the Mustang and Camaro are “pony” cars, but theCamaro has always been more of a horse.\n\nThe Mustang was introduced April 17, 1964, as a mid-1964 model. TheCamaro came out Sept. 26, 1966, as a 1967 model. Because the Camaro wasa late entry, General Motors Corp., its maker, figured that it had topump the car up with more muscle and gusto to attract attention. The GMstrategy worked.\n\nIn retrospect, the Camaro has always been more of a blue-collar carthan the Mustang, which seemed to sell better than the Camaro inwine-and-cheese neighborhoods.\n\nBut GM and Ford lately have been trying to aim their products moretoward America’s upper-middle class. Ford generally has been moresuccessful in that endeavor — which would be good, if we were talkingabout a family sedan or a sport-utility vehicle. But we’re talkinghotblooded convertibles, which are all about attitude. The Z28 Camarowins that contest hands down.\n\nThe Z28 is sleeker, sexier, faster and tighter than the Mustang GTconvertible. It’s free of any crossover pretensions. It aims for the thegut.\n\nSome comparisons:\n\nStyling: The Mustang goes for body panel scoops, a la the 1964original. It’s attractive, but smacks of artifice, especially with thatwhalelike air spoiler atop the trunk lid. But the smart, dual-podinterior styling of the Mustang beats the Darth Vader-like interior ofthe Z28 Camaro big time. The Mustang’s exterior/interior styling willremain the same for 1996.\n\nThe Z28’s exterior styling kicks butt — smooth, super fine. Theair spoiler atop the trunk lid literally flows into the car’s bodylines.\n\nEngines: The 1996 Z28 runs with the Corvette-derived 5.7-liter V-8rated 285 horsepower at 5,200 rpm. Torque is set at 325 pound-feet at2,400 rpm.\n\nThe 1995 Must ang GT is equipped with a 5-liter V-8 rated 215horsepower at 4,200 rpm. Torque on the current Mustang engine is set at285 pound-feet at 3,400 rpm.\n\nFor ’96, the Mustang GT convertible gets Ford’s new, modular4.6-liter V-8, which has practically the same horsepower and torque asthe current GT 5-liter V-8. The difference is that the new engine islighter and more fuel-efficient.\n\nOther mechanicals: The Camaro Z28 and Mustang GT convertibles bothhave standard power four-wheel disc brakes. But the Z28 comes with astandard anti-lock system. On the ’95 and ’96 Mustang GT, anti-locks aresold as an option.\n\nThe standard transmission in the Mustang GT for 1995 and 1996 is afive-speed manual. A four-speed automatic is optional. The Camaro Z28comes with a standard six-speed — repeat, six-speed — manual gearbox.A four-speed automatic is optional in the Camaro.\n\nSafety: Both convertibles are very stable cars, which means thatyou are not likely to roll them over and lose you r head. Both areequipped with dual-front air bags and all of the appropriate side-impactcrash protections. Both run faster than the law allows.\n\nComplaints: A squeak emanated from the left rear side of the 1995Mustang GT whenever the top was down. Hated that noise!\n\nThe Z28 could use a bit less testosterone and a bit more finesse,especially in the engine-roar department. It’s kind of adolescent to leteverybody know you’re coming.\n\nPraise: Both convertibles are hot runners and mostly fun to drive.\n\nHead-turning quotients: Camaro Z28 — “Ooh, baby!” Mustang GT –“Good morning, honey.”\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Better front-passenger ride in theMustang GT, which has better front-passenger foot space than the CamaroZ28. Better behind-the-wheel feel in the Z28. Both cars offer onlymarginal comfort for rear-seat passengers, even though the Mustang GThas a slight edge in that area.\n\nAll-around better handling in the Z28, and I don’t think it justwas because it was a ’96 model. The ’95 Camaro convertible also handledbetter than the somewhat wobbly-in-curves ’95 Mustang GT.\n\nExcellent braking in both cars.\n\nMileage: Nothing to cheer about in either car. The Camaro Z28 gotabout 19 miles per gallon (15.5-gallon tank, an estimated 280-mile rangeon usable volume of recommended premium unleaded), combinedcity-highway, mostly driver only.\n\nThe 1995 Mustang GT also got around 19 miles per gallon(15.4-gallon tank, an estimated 278-mile range on usable volume ofregular unleaded), combined city-highway and mostly driver only.\n\nSound systems: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette in Mustang GT, FordMach 460 system. Totally righteous. Optional Bose sound system with fivespeakers arranged in cross-firing pattern in the Camaro Z28. Boss boogiehere too.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 1995 Ford Mustang GT convertible is$22,795. Dealer’s invoice is $20,538. Price as tested is $27,430,including $4,135 in options and a $500 destination charge. Ford willattempt to run as close as possible to this pricing in 1996.\n\nEstimated base price on the 1996 Chevrolet Camaro is $24,000.Estimated dealer invoice is $21,500. Estimated price as tested is$28,000, including an estimated $3,500 in options and a $500 destinationcharge. Prices on the ’96 Camaro were not firm at this writing.\n\nPurse-strings note: Both Mustang GT and Camaro Z28 convertibles are”want” cars, as opposed to “need.” Still, I want the Camaro Z28.",

      "expert_review": "The Ford Mustang went on sale April 17, 1964, with a base price of $2,368.\n\nTo commemorate Mustang’s 35th anniversary, Ford has come up with a limited-edition (5,500 copies to be sold in the U.S., a few still left) anniversary GT coupe and convertible.\n\nThe GT, powered by a 4.6-liter, 260-h.p. V-8, features body-colored hood scoop, deck-lid spoiler, side scoops and rocker panel moldings; 17-inch, five-spoke aluminum wheels with galloping pony logo; black, silver, white or red exterior finishes; and a variety of 35th anniversary logos.\n\nLooks good and doesn’t act its age, but this is no Cobra. Don’t expect slap-you-back-in-your-seat acceleration. And be prepared for stiff sports-tuned suspension. Ford has yet to adopt General Motors’ new sports-car philosophy that no pain-no gain, makes no sense.\n\nBut keep in mind that soon, perhaps 2002, a Mustang will arrive, built off the same platform as the Lincoln LS sedan and the coming Ford Thunderbird coupe, that promises better ride and handling as well as better performance, not to mention more room.\n\nWe tested the GT convertible, basically a $24,965 GT with a $2,695 35th anniversary package that includes anniversary logos and script on any item that doesn’t move.\n\nOptions included 4-speed automatic at $815; traction control at $230; sound-system upgrade at $395; convenience group (power driver’s seat, speed control, rear window defroster) at $550; and smoker’s package (ashtray instead of another cupholder) at $15. With a $525 freight charge, the sticker topped $30,000.\n\nIf you can’t afford $30,000, call 877-35-YEARS (877-359-3277) for information about less-expensive anniversary collectibles, from trading cards to water colors to table games.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord celebrated the Mustangs 35th anniversary in 1999 with major styling changes and horsepower improvements, but only minor changes will be seen for 2000.\n\nMustangs chief rivals are the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, and while those cars are in danger of getting the ax by General Motors, Ford apparently sees a future for its muscle car. The company plans to introduce a new Mustang during the 2002 model year on a new rear-drive platform.\n\nMustang comes in V-6 and V-8 versions and as a limited-production, high-performance SVT Cobra model that is covered in a separate report.\n\nExterior\nThe styling changes in 1999 were geared toward resurrecting memories of the original Mustang. They include larger side air scoops ahead of the rear wheels and a more prominent galloping pony on the grille.\n\nMustang comes in coupe and convertible body styles, and the latter has a power soft-top with a glass rear window with defogger. At 183 inches bumper to bumper, the Mustang is about a foot shorter than the Camaro. Restyling in 1999 gave the Mustang a more substantial look compared to models from 1994 to 1998.\n\nInterior\nThe Mustang is a few inches taller than the Camaro, and it pays off in more upright seating and easier entry and exit, though the doors still require a lot of room to open fully. The rear seat is better suited for kids than adults, and cargo volume is a modest 11 cubic feet in the coupe and 8 cubic feet in the convertible.\n\nA twin-pod dashboard design resembles that of the original Mustang, and controls are placed conveniently for easy operation while driving.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.8-liter V-6 engine in the base coupe and convertible gained 40 horsepower in 1999  to 190  and it delivers adequate acceleration and passing power. The 4.6-liter V-8 in the GT models gained 35 hp  to 260  and that transforms the Mustang into a sprinter.\n\nPerformance\nWith either engine, the Mustang still trails comparable versions of the Camaro and Firebird in acceleration. The Mustang is easier to live with, however, because of its smoother, quieter ride and more accommodating interiors. If no-holds-barred performance is your goal, check out the Camaro SS or SVT Cobra version of the Mustang.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Give a Ford Mustang to a bunch of high-performance car nuts and what do you get? The Mustang Cobra.\n\nTweaked by the Special Vehicle Team (SVT), Ford’s in-house hot rod shop, the Cobra is not only considerably faster than the standard Mustang but also stops quicker, rides smoother and acquits itself better in the pot-holed world of everyday driving.\n\nCobras come in coupe or convertible. Production is limited to 7,000 coupes and 2,450 convertibles, and they are sold only through the 707 Ford dealers licensed to sell SVT products. The coupe starts at $25,860 and the convertible $28,660.\n\nBalanced performance is the key to vehicles developed by SVT. Their credo is much like that of European makers who value handling and braking as much or more so than outright acceleration. Mustang Cobras are more than just stop-light wheelspin artists. They are cross-country runners as much at home galloping down country lanes as cruising the interstates.\n\nWith a suspension tuned to be firm but pliant, and with bigger brakes both front and rear, Cobras are designed for enthusiast drivers on a reasonable budget. With a list price of just under $26,000 it is one of the performance bargains of the year. It scoots to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds and has a top track speed of 152 mph. That compares favorably to a Camaro or Corvette.\n\nThe most significant difference between the Cobra and a regular Mustang GT is found in the engine compartment. Both have 4.6-liter V8s, but the Cobra uses a double-overhead-cam (DOHC) version that pumps out 95 more horsepower — 305 versus 215. That is a quantum leap.\n\nThe Cobra’s engine breathes with greater efficiency due to four valves per cylinder and a twin-throttle-body fuel injection system. Normally an engine so configured would show its stuff only when revved high, but that is not so with this one. It has more than adequate pulling power at low speed, yet loosen its reins and the added shot of adrenaline when the secondary throttles open at 3,250 rpm will knock your hat into the back seat.\n\nThis is a car that demands your undivided attention if you intend to explore the full potential of its performance envelope.\n\nEven though the suspension is tuned to provide a reasonably supple ride on city streets, it is still firm by most passenger-car standards and can be jarring over sharp bumps. The 17-inch wheels are shod with low-profile, high-performance tires picked for their grip. Consequently, the ride they offer is occasionally rough, but that is a worthy tradeoff for the security they provide when you knife into an exit ramp with excess exuberance.\n\nTrue to its muscle car bloodlines, the Cobra is a vehicle that requires physical input to get a performance output. The gearshift is firm and direct; the clutch pedal heavy but not tiring. A trip in rush-hour traffic will require more effort than the family sedan, but the results you get are more satisfying if you like fast cars.\n\nThe compromise continues ins ide, where a small back seat is only usable for a short time by adults. Ask my wife, who volunteered to scrunch up back there for a short trip when there were three of us aboard. Her knees were tucked up under her chin and her head rubbed the roof. The back seat is a space best left for the young’uns.\n\nUp front, things are much better. The heavily contoured bucket seats provide the kind of support needed for vigorous driving, and they have a wide range of adjustment. Headroom is none too generous, but that didn’t bother me (a benefit to being less than six-feet tall).\n\nThe Cobra’s instrumentation is much like that of the standard Mustang except the dials have white faces with black numbers. At night they reverse colors and the numerals glow light green. Very pleasing on the eyes.\n\nOne of my only gripes concerns the outdated stereo that has confusing push buttons instead of nice large knobs like most of the other Ford products.\n\nThe cupholder that folds out of the console b ween the seats interferes with your right elbow.\n\nSince the Cobra came out in 1994 the only major change has been the addition of the twin-cam engine last year. Visually, the 1997 is almost identical to the 1994. A Pacific Green paint has been added to the red, white and black colors specific to Cobras.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test car was $25,860. The only options were the Mach 460 AM//FM stereo with compact disc player. The sticker price was $27,195.\n\nWarranty\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Cobra is a Mustang on steroids. It has more horsepower, bigger brakes and a more pliant ride.\n\nCounterpoint: The old-style radio controls need upgrading, and the back seat is a challenge for adults.\n\nSPECS\nENGINE: 4.6-liter, V8\nTRANSMISSION: Five-speed\nWHEELBASE: 101.3 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,439 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $25,860\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $27,195\nMPG RATING: 18 city, 26 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Adding power may make a better sport coupe, but it doesn’t always make a better ragtop, and Ford’s ’96 Mustang Cobra Convertible is yet another case in point.\n\nI don’t mean to suggest that the 305-horsepower, all- aluminum version of Ford’s 4.6-liter, V8 engine makes the going less stimulating. Au contraire.\n\nIts performance is distinctly different from the big 5.7- liter V8s available in the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird. But when all those valves (32 of ’em) and overhead camshafts (four) start turning at higher speeds — 4,000 r.p.m. and above — this engine is pure delight.\n\nAs addictive as it is, however, the engine’s additional power also magnifies the basic weakness of this chassis.\n\nEven though the current Mustang was specifically engineered with the convertible in mind, and Ford’s Special Vehicle Team has done extensive strengthening for the Cobra version, there’s still too much flex in the chassis.\n\nAnd that adds up to a car that isn’t quite sure what it wants to be.\n\nFor all the engineering updates that went into the latest Mustang make over, Ford stopped well short of a redesigning the car from the ground up.\n\nEven though this is America’s favorite sporty car, its annual sales didn’t justify the investment that go with an all- new car.\n\nAs a result, this is the oldest chassis in Ford’s entire inventory, rear-wheel drive or otherwise.\n\nNew suspension components and other engineering tweaks can give an old chassis a new lease on life in terms of ride and handling. The Mustang Cobra coupe provides striking proof. But they can’t really compensate for the absence of a roof.\n\nAs a consequence, the convertible version has shakes and shudders in bumpy going that don’t show up in the coupe.\n\nI emerged from a week of driving the Cobra convertible with a sense of the engine being considerably faster than the rest of the car.\n\nIn sporty driving on twisting back roads, the rear end hops around nervously on small chatter bumps, and overall ride is compromised by little things like freeway expansion joints, which become just a bit too perceivable to both the driver and passengers.\n\nStructural compromises also show up in the noise department.\n\nConvertibles are notorious for accumulating rattles and squeaks as time goes by, and our Cobra tester had already developed one rattle somewhere in the left rear quarter, even though there were fewer than 2,500 miles on the odometer.\n\nWith a suspension tuned to deliver sports-car handling, plus aggressive low-profile tires, it seems likely to me that other irritating body and chassis noises will join in as mileage accumulates.\n\nThere was another noise source in our test car that had nothing to do with the structure.\n\nThe Mustang Cobra only comes with a five-speed manual transmission. An automatic is not even an option. That transmission and rear end produce a little mo re gear whine than is really acceptable by contemporary standards. This is audible at almost all speeds, but it becomes particularly annoying in fifth gear at fast freeway velocities.\n\nDrivetrain noise such as this might be OK in a racing machine, but it’s out of place in a street car.\n\nOn the plus side of the noise ledger, the V8 engine produces very sophisticated music when it’s making power.\n\nIt’s not the lazy basso rumble we’ve been conditioned to by decades of Detroit overhead valve V8s, but I find the blend of whiskey tenor exhaust and precision-orchestrated overhead cam machinery is every bit as seductive.\n\nWhile the big difference between the Cobra and the other Mustang convertibles lies in things that don’t show at a glance, there are a few visible reminders.\n\nThe Cobra coupe and convertible come with their own unique set of handsome 17-inch aluminum alloy wheels, and sporty bucket seats with better than average lateral support and ery good long-haul comfort.\n\nThe seats in our test car were clad in creamy black leather that made a spiffy contrast with the arctic white exterior and the white top, a combination that got plenty of longing looks during a weekend of cruising the Hamptons on New York’s Long Island.\n\nAnother interesting Cobra touch is the instrument package. By day, the gauges are white with black markings. But at night, the lighting reverses the effect, and the numbers glow bluish white on black. Gimmicky, perhaps, but definitely cool.\n\nOur tester was also equipped with a very good AM/FM/CD sound system, although its controls could use the upsizing we’ve seen in some other newer Ford products.\n\nOperation of basic systems was precise and free of glitches.\n\nThe top is simple. Undo the two latches atop the windshield, touch a button and down it goes.\n\nThere’s a glass rear window — no concerns with plastic window fogging or cracking — equipped with an electric defogger, and the top seals well. No wind whistles and no leaks in our car-wash check.\n\nShift engagements for the five-speed transmission were exemplary, and the steering provided good road feel, albeit with a little more low-speed power assist than I like in a car conceived to satisfy sporty appetites.\n\nBraking performance, with big discs and standard antilock, is first rate.\n\nLike most sporty coupes and convertibles, the Mustang is very short on rear-seat legroom and trunk space.\n\nIf four-passenger seating is a priority, Chrysler’s Sebring JXi is worth a look, although you’ll give up the option of V8 punch that’s available in the Mustang, Camaro and Firebird.\n\nIf you want four-passenger seating with performance, the Saab 900 V6 and 900 Turbo convertibles are possibilities, although the price goes up to around $40,000.\n\nOur Cobra convertible test car was some 10 grand south of that, but still in the realm that’s likely to make most of us think more than twice.\n\nThe basic Cobra ragtop starts at $28,105, a figure that includes the comfort and convenience features you’d expect of a car in this price class.\n\nOur test car was enhanced by a $1,335 preferred equipment package that provided leather seats, compact disc player and antitheft system, pushing the total perilously close to the $30,000 frontier.\n\nNaturally, this includes the extensive suspension tweaking by the Special Vehicle Team plus that superb 305-hp V8.\n\nBut it seems to me that the Cobra convertible makes promises it can’t quite keep.\n\nTrue, the power is intoxicating, but its handling and ride don’t quite keep up.\n\nBeyond that, this engine likes revs. It doesn’t have the kind of relaxed low-r.p.m. muscle you get in the 285-hp versions of GM’s 5.7-liter V8s, which are offered with an automatic transmission option.\n\nClassic American pony-car ragtops are all about cruisin’ and lookin’ good. The Cobra convertible certai nly does this, but the GT version — with its 215-hp 4.6-liter V8 — does it just as well, for about $4,000 less.\n\nIf you’re interested in all-around performance — handling, as well as straight ahead — the Cobra coupe is an excellent choice.\n\nBut unless you happen to be a collector, the Cobra convertible is harder to justify.\n\nWithout a roof, the Mustang Cobra is like a star sprinter trying to run the 100-yard dash in street shoes.\n\nHe’ll look good trying to do it, but it doesn’t quite make sense.\n\nSPECS:\nRating: 2 wheels\n\nVehicle type: Front-engine, rear-drive, four-seat convertible\n\nKey competitors: Chevrolet Camaro Z28, Pontiac Firebird Trans Am\n\nBase price: $28,105\n\nPrice as tested: $29,440\n\nStandard equipment: ABS; dual air bags; air conditioning; AM/ FM/cassette sound system; power top, seats, windows and m rrors; keyless remote entry; cruise control\n\nEngine: 305-hp, 4.6-liter V8\n\nEPA fuel econ.: 18 m.p.g. city/26 hwy.\n\nCurb weight: 3,540 pounds\n\nWheelbase: 101.3 inches\n\nLength: 182.5 inches\n\nWidth: 71.8 inches\n\nHeight: 53.3 inches\n\nWhere assembled: Dearborn",

      "expert_review": "There are many Mustang enthusiasts who probably never are going to warm up to any modern Mustang.\n\nTime – in an automotive sense – stopped for them in 1973 on the day the first generation Mustang went out of production.\n\nThat might be one reason why Ford reached into the past for inspiration for its new Mustang. There are a lot of people out there who feel Ford made a U-turn to a dead-end street when it brought out the Mustang II in 1974.\n\nIn fact, the second generation of the Mustang – and even the third, built from 1979 to 1993 – had little of the style and none of spirit that made the original one of the most loved American cars.\n\nBut stop a minute.\n\nLet’s say you are a fan of the older Mustangs and that your idea of the quintessential pony car is a ’66 2+2 GT Fastback with a 289 High Performance engine and a four-speed manual transmission. If that’s the case, then you ought to check out the Mustang Cobra. Chances are you’ll appreciate what Ford has done with this car.\n\nThis vehicle deserves to wear the Mustang name more than any other car Ford has built since 1973.\n\nIn terms of style and performance, the new Mustang Cobra is true to everything that made the original car so great.\n\nCompared with the ’94 Mustang GT, the Cobra offers 25 more horsepower, better suspension system and cosmetic and interior improvements.\n\nFootnote: The Mustang Cobra is a limited production vehicle produced by Ford’s Special Vehicle Team. Not all Ford dealers are carrying the Cobra.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nFord has used the venerable 5.0-liter (302 cubic inch) V-8 and its derivatives in everything from dump trucks to luxury sedans during the past three decades.\n\nHowever, I can’t remember Ford’s cast-iron workhorse being in a finer state of tune than it is in the1994 Cobra. Horsepower is rated at a robust 240.\n\nWith that many ponies under the hood, the Cobra strikes fast when you touch the accelerator. But the 3,300-pound car is not a one-trick pony. In addition to being a potent force from stoplight to stoplight, it is very capable of delivering superb performance on long high-speed highway trips.\n\nThese days, when one talks about a Mustang, someone is sure to mention the new Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird with their 275-horsepower Corvette engines.\n\nBut a quick glance at the road test summaries of enthusiast magazines shows that the Mustang Cobra compares well against the two GM sports coupes.\n\nFor instance, Road & Track magazine clocked a Cobra at 6.9 seconds from 0-to-60 mph. (Ford says it measured the trip at 6.3 seconds.) Meanwhile, Road & Track timed the Firebird Formula at 6.7 seconds.\n\nThe gearing is wonderfully matched to the engine’s horsepower. At low speeds the V-8 pulls strongly. But in second gear you can reach65 mph before the tachometer needle makes to it to the 6,000 rpm limit.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, you feel as if the drivetrain is amazingly flexible.\n\nAt highway speeds in fifth gear, the engine is barely ticking over at 2,500 rpm.\n\nFord seems to have struck just the right chord with the Cobra’s exhaust note. It’s a low rumble that turns into a hoarse growl as the engine winds up.\n\nThe clutch pedal is smooth and easy, and the shifter clicks cleanly into each gear. This helps make the car very civilized in stop-and-go traffic.\n\nFuel mileage was poor, but that’s probably my fault. For the week I drove the Cobra, my right foot took on a leadlike demeanor.\n\nFor those of us who love to drive and who love cars that make all the right noises, you can’t help but wind up the Cobra’s engine each time you get behind the wheel. In the city I logged 15 mpg of regular unleaded. On a long road trip, that figure increased to a respectable 25 mpg.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Mustang Cobra is a red-hot sports coupe, but it doesn’t punish the driver and passengers with a stiff, back-breaking ride.\n\nMany sports coupes rely on a verystiff suspension system to keep the car’s body straight in tight curves. Not the Mustang Cobra. Even though the suspension feels soft, you’ll have no problem putting the Cobra through its paces.\n\nI found that the body stays straight and the car remains easy to control in sharp turns. This is something of a mystery to me. One of the first things I noticed when I braked the test car hard is how much the front end nose-dives – an action usually associated with soft suspension. I didn’t think there was any way the car would handle well when the time came to push it to the limit.\n\nBut it did.\n\nI rounded some corners with my foot on the accelerator and found the Cobra was ready, willing and able to devour such curves.\n\nThe steering has a precise and lively feel, and huge disc-brake rotors on all four wheels, ventilated for quicker cooling, make for strong and predictable stops.\n\nUnderneath, the Cobra uses a live axle (instead of independent) in the rear and MacPherson struts up front.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nIn the past five years, Ford has really come to the forefront of American automakers with its innovative and stylish interior designs. In fact, I can’t remember the last Ford I drove that didn’t have an expressive, user-friendly interior.\n\nThe Cobra is no exception.\n\nYou feel comfortable from the moment you sit in the driver’s seat.\n\nThe dash layout is very simple. All the switches, buttons and controls are labeled cleanly and within easy reach.\n\nThree rotary knobs make adjusting the air conditioner little more than a reflex action. Using the controls require very little thought because of their placement and labeling.\n\nJust below the air-conditioning controls is the AM/FM cassette radio and an optional CD player.\n\nThe only other control on the dash is the light switch. Cruise control switches are located on the steering wheel and can be operated with your thumbs.\n\nOn an 11-hour, 720-mile trip to Dothan, Ala., the Cobra proved to be comfortable. The leather seats are soft, but give nice support to the lower back and legs.\n\nAs with other Fords, you can adjust the lumbar support by pressing a switch on the side of the seat.\n\nUnlike other sport coupes, the Cobra is family friendly. A child’s safety seat easily fits in the rear without blocking vision.\n\nNot only that, but an average-sized adult can be comfortable in the rear seat. There’s a nice amount of leg and headroom.\n\nThe radio-controlled lock system is terrific. Its range was demonstrated accidentally when the car’s alarm went off when the panic button on the black plastic key ring was mistakenly pressed while I was inside a restaurant.\n\nSince the new Mustang came out in December, Ford has increased production three times to keep up with demand.\n\nFrom the base model six-cylinder version to the high performance Cobra, Ford designers and engineers seemed to have captured the look, style and, more i mportantly, the spirit of the original Mustang.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Cobra is the meanest Mustang Ford has built since the early 1970s. The highly tuned 5.0-liter V-8 packs a venomous bite. And handling is superb.",

      "expert_review": "When the conversation turns to age, the two names that usually come upare Methuselah and Mustang.\n\nThough we never had the pleasure of meeting the biblical character, we`ve had many experiences with the automobile.\n\nFord`s little sports coupe has had tremendous staying power, which isespecially noteworthy because the man who claims to be its “father“ isChrysler Corp.`s chairman, Lee Iacocca.\n\nRegardless of the parentage, Mustang still attracts buyers, though itsteeth have grown so long they scrape the pavement. Perhaps only the venerableVolkswagen Beetle has enjoyed such loyal fans.\n\nPatience, people. A new, high-performance Mustang comes out for 1993, and in the fall of 1994 a restyled model will appear, for the 1995 model year.Until then you`ll have to live with a car that has a few wrinkles and warts. We test-drove the 1992 Mustang convertible. That Ford offers aconvertible Mustang is one reason youth and those who`d like a shot atretaining it for a moment or two still buy the car.\n\nThe 5-liter V-8 is another attraction. It`s still quick. About the onlytime it slows is when it approaches a filling station. Let youth be (self)served.\n\nIn driving the `92 Mustang LX convertible, we found squeaks and rattlesand a suspension that seemed to want to polka when all we wanted to do waswaltz. We saw more of our local Amoco dealer in one week than we had in theprevious month-and we didn`t drive one mile more than usual.\n\nAnd yet we enjoyed the time spent with the aged warrior, mostly in top-down form while cruising the roadways. Mustang makes no pretenses and noslick claims; it just offers laid-back, open-air motoring.\n\nBase price is $19,644. A driver-side air bag is standard.",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — The latest salvo in the Detroit muscle car wars has been fired from Dearborn, and it’s going to land squarely in Chevrolet’s yard. The 2018 Ford Mustang is here, sporting more power, a new transmission, suspension refinements and new options to keep the original pony car fresh and competitive well into its fifth decade.\n\nRelated:  2018 Ford Mustang GT’s Magic Numbers Are 4-6-0: 460 HP, 4 Seconds to 60\n\nI recently flew to Malibu, Calif., for a first drive of the new Mustang and came away both impressed and concerned — impressed by the Mustang’s abilities in both four-cylinder turbo and eight-cylinder monster guise, and concerned about how expensive America’s iconic sports car has become.\n\nLooks… Like a Mustang\n\nDespite the fact that the Mustang got a mild makeover, you’d be forgiven for not really noticing. Instead of the upswept headlights of the 2017 model, now you get more droopy-eyed headlights in the 2018. The hood and fenders are slightly reshaped, and a newly angular lower bumper is fitted, but the overall look isn’t very different at all. Ford supposedly also restyled the back end, but damned if we can spot how.\n\nAnd that’s actually OK, as the current shape of the Mustang is probably the best-looking one since the original ’64 thanks to classic cues combined with modern equipment. It’s exceedingly hard to update a classic icon, so Ford has wisely chosen to take a more conservative approach to modifying a good thing.\n\nA Choice of Heart\n\nFor 2018, powertrain choices have been simplified with the discontinuation of the naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V-6 engine, leaving the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder and fire-breathing 5.0-liter V-8. Both have seen output increases: The turbo four still makes 310 horsepower but is up to 350 pounds-feet of torque, 30 pounds-feet more than last year. The V-8 has had its fuel system thoroughly redone and now pumps out a hefty 460 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque, up from 2017’s 435 hp and 400 pounds-feet.\n\nEither engine can be had with a six-speed manual transmission, reworked for the V-8 to now have a twin-disc clutch and dual-mass flywheel, or a new 10-speed automatic transmission. Power goes to the rear wheels with either powertrain. The suspension gets some modifications as well, with new shock absorbers for all Mustangs, new stabilizer bars and a new cross-axis joint for the rear suspension. The MagneRide electronic adaptive suspension is now available as an additional option when you specify the Performance Pack (this suspension was previously available only on the egregiously powerful Mustang GT350 track monster).\n\nAll of the engine and transmission combinations are entertaining, but the four-cylinder and V-8 cars feel like two very different animals. The EcoBoost turbo feels light, nimble and tossable, and it can be thrown into corners and transitions with ease. While the car is only 150 pounds lighter than the V-8 model (according to Ford engineers), the nose seems to exhibit much more responsive turn-in, and the front-to-rear balance feels more equal. With the exhaust track from the turbo engine (piped in through the audio system), you feel like you’re driving a Japanese sports compact car, not a chest-thumping American muscle machine.\n\nThe 10-speed automatic is amazingly well adapted to the power available from the turbo, and the upgraded brakes of the Performance Pack never faded once in 15 miles of twisty Latigo Canyon hairpins and switchbacks. This is a modern performance car that delivers massive smiles; you will run out of skill before it runs out of ability.\n\nThe V-8 is even more of a good thing. While it feels decidedly heavier, the newfound power and torque from the upgraded engine transforms the Mustang. Whereas the outgoing model always felt poky until you really put your foot into it, the new one is sprightly and immediate in its delivery. Credit goes in part to that 10-speed automatic again: Pop the car into Sport or Sport Plus mode, and the transmission shifts to an aggressive sport configuration that holds lower gears, downshifts quickly and responds almost too urgently for street use.\n\nThe problem is, the Normal mode favors fuel-economy tuning, so finding a happy medium may be a challenge. Or, forgo the automatic entirely and shift yourself with the outstanding six-speed manual — which features a clutch and shift action so light, especially when compared with competitors like the stick-shift Dodge Challenger, that you find yourself shifting a lot more often simply because there’s so little effort required to do it. Suffice it to say, there isn’t a bad powertrain combination in the Mustang anymore — they’re all massively entertaining.\n\nOne option you’ll almost certainly want to specify is the Performance Pack. While the standard Mustang’s suspension is still highly capable, the upgraded brakes, stickier Michelin summer tires, sportier suspension and limited-slip differential all combine to make everything perform even better. On the GT V-8, you can also add the MagneRide suspension, which increases control and allows you to tune your Mustang for either track duty or grocery getting with just a couple of switch flips. Consider this: All export Mustangs ship with the Performance Pack as standard equipment, which says to me that this is how the Mustang is really supposed to be equipped.\n\nInside, Tech Is the New Black\n\nWhile the only immediately obvious visual difference to the interior are a couple of new seat patterns and colors, there are some real usability changes present. Ford has upped the available technology with some new electronics packages and features. Front and center is the new optional 12.4-inch digital cluster, a fully reconfigurable instrument panel that offers unprecedented levels of customizability and an ease-of-use that belies its creation by former video game designers.\n\nThere’s only one nagging issue with all of the Mustang’s electronics: Switching between drive modes isn’t all that simple. For instance, you have a choice of several modes (Normal, Sport Plus, Track, Drag and Snow/Wet). They’re selected by a toggle low and to the right on the dash, but the toggle goes only one way, so you have to cycle through them all to get where you want.\n\nThere’s also a Sport mode in addition to the Sport Plus mode, but you don’t select that with the toggle; instead, you choose it with the automatic transmission by pulling the shifter into S instead of D. But you can adjust the steering effort independently through a separate toggle. So engaging plain old Sport mode requires you to put the shifter in S and the steering toggle in Sport. Selecting Sport Plus via the other toggle adjusts more settings and makes it even more aggressive. Got that? Took me a while, for sure.\n\nAnd then there’s the optional electronically adjustable exhaust. There are four different settings for the exhaust, ranging from Silent to Track, which are accurate descriptions. You can even set the Silent setting to activate between certain hours, so as not to disturb your neighbors (or to sneak home late and not alert your spouse … or so I imagine). But before you put it in Track mode, make sure you’ve finished any conversations with passengers — the noise is formidable. Ford does augment the natural exhaust sound with some piped-in soundtrack, but who cares? It only makes the whole experience sound amazing.\n\nSave Your Pennies for These Ponies\n\nThe problem starts when you look at how much this whiz-bang technology and sophistication will cost you. The base price for a new 2018 Mustang EcoBoost with a standard manual transmission is $26,485 including destination charge (interestingly, this is almost exactly what my old 1997 Mustang SVT Cobra cost new). Add an automatic transmission for $1,595. Unfortunately, the price quickly climbs from here — if you want Sync 3, a nine-speaker stereo and rear parking sensors, they’re part of a $2,000 package. There are several more packages you can specify as well, including the Performance Package ($2,495 for the EcoBoost, $3,995 for the GT), various wheel and tire packages, the MagneRide suspension, the fancy exhaust, premium audio and more.\n\nYou can add everything up and pay nearly $44,000 for a four-cylinder Mustang, or go nuts and get a loaded GT convertible for more than $58,000. While not as pricey as the track-oriented GT350, it’s still an amazing amount of money for an American pony car. Want the best bang for the buck? Go for an EcoBoost fastback manual-transmission model and specify just one option: the Performance Pack. Cloth seats, no Sync 3, no fancy audio or even backup sensors — but you’ll get a highly entertaining, damned good-looking, 310-hp, turbocharged four-seat sports car for less than $29,000 out the door.\n\nIn defense of the higher price, however, you get a pony car that’s more sophisticated, more capable, better built and better looking than ever before. Either powertrain can hang with cars costing thousands of dollars more from European luxury brands that you wouldn’t normally expect to compete with a Ford. But the new Mustang can and does show those brands its taillights. It’s not just the best Mustang Ford’s ever built, but it might just be the best sports car they’ve ever done.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I’m slightly annoyed when the first Ford representative I introduce myself to at a Mustang convertible event in Florida this weekend immediately mentions, “There’s at least one thing you’ll like about the Mustang. O.P.I. has developed a line of Mustang nail polish matching the paint colors of the car.”\n\nNow, I admit, I don’t care about torque and horsepower nearly as much as the other journalists at the event (as a matter of fact I couldn’t care less). I admit that I appreciate a great nail color just as much as the next woman. However, I’m torqued that I’m perceived from the outside as being interested in only that “one thing” about a vehicle that’s as American as apple pie.\n\nMy initial distaste dissipating, I realize what a brilliant marketing concept O.P.I. has developed, tapping into the $83 billion market of female automotive consumers and alternately softening the muscle image of Mustang.\n\nBefore long, I’m digging into samples of You Make Me Vroom, Revved Up & Red-y (my personal favorite – looks really hot on toes), and Gone Platinum in 60 Seconds. They will all be available beginning June 1, 2005 at salons such as ULTA, Trade Secret, Regis and JC Penney.\n\nPedicure aside, it’s time to drive this baby. The drop-top version of the Mustang has a slightly less masculine line to it than the traditional hard-top. Paint it in a gorgeous Florida-esque metallic green or blue and I’m in heaven.\n\nColor is a recurring theme with the Mustang. The addition of an interior upgrade package offers the “My Color” system. This allows the driver to alternate between 125 color shades for illuminating the instrument panel. Although this seems like something that would be particularly attractive to my 19-year-old brother taking his date to Look-out Mountain, believe it or not the average age of a Mustang buyer is 41.\n\nNow, to answer your biggest question: Can you put kids and child seats in a Mustang convertible? YES YOU CAN (although NHTSA crash tests have not yet been preformed on the ’05 Mustang Convertible). David Fee, Mustang Marketing Manager has confirmed this. As the proud new father of an 8-month-old boy, David has indeed driven with his infant son in the back. David adds that it’s quite easy to lift a child seat into a car with no roof. I concur. After riding in the back seat for over an hour, I can also vouch for the fact that full-sized adults fit as well.\n\nHalf of all sports cars sold today are Mustangs. It’s an American classic that seems to keep up with the times without exuding much effort. It is a blast to drive. So much so that I’m reluctant to get out of the driver’s seat. With V6, V8, automatic and manual configurations, there’s a Mustang out there for everyone.\n\nI realize that this is not the “quintessential mom-mobile,” so please don’t send me hoards of e-mails asking me why I’m writing about a car that is obviously not a family car. The 2005 Ford Mustang convertible is an affordable choice for a second car that’s just for fun. That is why this review will ultimately reside in the “just for fun” category of Motherproof.com. *For more information on the Ford Mustang convertible and its safety features visit Cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Ford Mustang?\n\nThe Ford Mustang is a retro-themed sports car that comes as a coupe or convertible with nominal seating for four. Now in its 60th model year, the Mustang finds itself essentially in a class of one, as the rival Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger have recently been discontinued. The base drivetrain is a stout turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder that makes 315 horsepower and is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. While this engine provides plenty of zip, few things are more visceral than the available 5.0-liter V-8. It churns out 480 hp in the GT trim, and the line-topping Dark Horse ups this to an even 500 hp. The Dark Horse also gets special trim touches and high-performance enhancements like upgraded brakes, additional oil coolers, and an available handling package that includes stiffer springs and low-profile competition tires. While the turbo-four comes only with an automatic transmission, the V-8 is available with a six-speed manual gearbox in addition to the 10-speed automatic.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Ford Mustang?\n\nTo celebrate a noteworthy Mustang birthday, Ford has introduced a 60th Anniversary Package. Offered only with the V-8 engine, this special appearance package can be had in one of three colors: Race Red, Vapor Blue and Wimbledon White. Silver or red stripes run along the rocker panels, while models in blue or red exterior paint get silver-colored side mirrors that mimic the chrome ones used on the original 1965 Mustang. A specific mesh grille and unique 20-inch alloy wheels further distinguish the 60th Anniversary models from the rest of the Mustang line.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Ford Mustang Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen\n12.4-inch digital instrument cluster\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nCloth upholstery\nTwo USB ports\nPush-button start\nProximity keyless entry\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high beams\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nLeather upholstery\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n12-speaker Bang & Olufsen stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\nEvasive steering assist\nTorsen limited-slip differential\nShould I Buy the 2025 Ford Mustang?\n\nThe Mustang delivers loads of retro appeal and excellent customizability, and last year’s redesign brought it a new tech-centric interior that brings it more up to date. While the base turbo four-cylinder provides reasonable fuel economy and plenty of pep, the brawny optional V-8 is hard to resist — even though you’ll have to spend around $13,500 to step up to a base GT coupe from a base four-cylinder coupe. Let’s not forget the Mustang GT and Dark Horse are available with a manual gearbox, something that’s increasingly rare among new cars — even performance-focused ones. Speaking of rare, this holds true for direct rivals to Ford’s pony car. With the recent demise of the Camaro and Challenger, the Mustang runs free in a nostalgic muscle-car field that’s down to one (at least for now).",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — The latest salvo in the Detroit muscle car wars has been fired from Dearborn, and it’s going to land squarely in Chevrolet’s yard. The 2018 Ford Mustang is here, sporting more power, a new transmission, suspension refinements and new options to keep the original pony car fresh and competitive well into its fifth decade.\n\nRelated:  2018 Ford Mustang GT’s Magic Numbers Are 4-6-0: 460 HP, 4 Seconds to 60\n\nI recently flew to Malibu, Calif., for a first drive of the new Mustang and came away both impressed and concerned — impressed by the Mustang’s abilities in both four-cylinder turbo and eight-cylinder monster guise, and concerned about how expensive America’s iconic sports car has become.\n\nLooks… Like a Mustang\n\nDespite the fact that the Mustang got a mild makeover, you’d be forgiven for not really noticing. Instead of the upswept headlights of the 2017 model, now you get more droopy-eyed headlights in the 2018. The hood and fenders are slightly reshaped, and a newly angular lower bumper is fitted, but the overall look isn’t very different at all. Ford supposedly also restyled the back end, but damned if we can spot how.\n\nAnd that’s actually OK, as the current shape of the Mustang is probably the best-looking one since the original ’64 thanks to classic cues combined with modern equipment. It’s exceedingly hard to update a classic icon, so Ford has wisely chosen to take a more conservative approach to modifying a good thing.\n\nA Choice of Heart\n\nFor 2018, powertrain choices have been simplified with the discontinuation of the naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V-6 engine, leaving the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder and fire-breathing 5.0-liter V-8. Both have seen output increases: The turbo four still makes 310 horsepower but is up to 350 pounds-feet of torque, 30 pounds-feet more than last year. The V-8 has had its fuel system thoroughly redone and now pumps out a hefty 460 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque, up from 2017’s 435 hp and 400 pounds-feet.\n\nEither engine can be had with a six-speed manual transmission, reworked for the V-8 to now have a twin-disc clutch and dual-mass flywheel, or a new 10-speed automatic transmission. Power goes to the rear wheels with either powertrain. The suspension gets some modifications as well, with new shock absorbers for all Mustangs, new stabilizer bars and a new cross-axis joint for the rear suspension. The MagneRide electronic adaptive suspension is now available as an additional option when you specify the Performance Pack (this suspension was previously available only on the egregiously powerful Mustang GT350 track monster).\n\nAll of the engine and transmission combinations are entertaining, but the four-cylinder and V-8 cars feel like two very different animals. The EcoBoost turbo feels light, nimble and tossable, and it can be thrown into corners and transitions with ease. While the car is only 150 pounds lighter than the V-8 model (according to Ford engineers), the nose seems to exhibit much more responsive turn-in, and the front-to-rear balance feels more equal. With the exhaust track from the turbo engine (piped in through the audio system), you feel like you’re driving a Japanese sports compact car, not a chest-thumping American muscle machine.\n\nThe 10-speed automatic is amazingly well adapted to the power available from the turbo, and the upgraded brakes of the Performance Pack never faded once in 15 miles of twisty Latigo Canyon hairpins and switchbacks. This is a modern performance car that delivers massive smiles; you will run out of skill before it runs out of ability.\n\nThe V-8 is even more of a good thing. While it feels decidedly heavier, the newfound power and torque from the upgraded engine transforms the Mustang. Whereas the outgoing model always felt poky until you really put your foot into it, the new one is sprightly and immediate in its delivery. Credit goes in part to that 10-speed automatic again: Pop the car into Sport or Sport Plus mode, and the transmission shifts to an aggressive sport configuration that holds lower gears, downshifts quickly and responds almost too urgently for street use.\n\nThe problem is, the Normal mode favors fuel-economy tuning, so finding a happy medium may be a challenge. Or, forgo the automatic entirely and shift yourself with the outstanding six-speed manual — which features a clutch and shift action so light, especially when compared with competitors like the stick-shift Dodge Challenger, that you find yourself shifting a lot more often simply because there’s so little effort required to do it. Suffice it to say, there isn’t a bad powertrain combination in the Mustang anymore — they’re all massively entertaining.\n\nOne option you’ll almost certainly want to specify is the Performance Pack. While the standard Mustang’s suspension is still highly capable, the upgraded brakes, stickier Michelin summer tires, sportier suspension and limited-slip differential all combine to make everything perform even better. On the GT V-8, you can also add the MagneRide suspension, which increases control and allows you to tune your Mustang for either track duty or grocery getting with just a couple of switch flips. Consider this: All export Mustangs ship with the Performance Pack as standard equipment, which says to me that this is how the Mustang is really supposed to be equipped.\n\nInside, Tech Is the New Black\n\nWhile the only immediately obvious visual difference to the interior are a couple of new seat patterns and colors, there are some real usability changes present. Ford has upped the available technology with some new electronics packages and features. Front and center is the new optional 12.4-inch digital cluster, a fully reconfigurable instrument panel that offers unprecedented levels of customizability and an ease-of-use that belies its creation by former video game designers.\n\nThere’s only one nagging issue with all of the Mustang’s electronics: Switching between drive modes isn’t all that simple. For instance, you have a choice of several modes (Normal, Sport Plus, Track, Drag and Snow/Wet). They’re selected by a toggle low and to the right on the dash, but the toggle goes only one way, so you have to cycle through them all to get where you want.\n\nThere’s also a Sport mode in addition to the Sport Plus mode, but you don’t select that with the toggle; instead, you choose it with the automatic transmission by pulling the shifter into S instead of D. But you can adjust the steering effort independently through a separate toggle. So engaging plain old Sport mode requires you to put the shifter in S and the steering toggle in Sport. Selecting Sport Plus via the other toggle adjusts more settings and makes it even more aggressive. Got that? Took me a while, for sure.\n\nAnd then there’s the optional electronically adjustable exhaust. There are four different settings for the exhaust, ranging from Silent to Track, which are accurate descriptions. You can even set the Silent setting to activate between certain hours, so as not to disturb your neighbors (or to sneak home late and not alert your spouse … or so I imagine). But before you put it in Track mode, make sure you’ve finished any conversations with passengers — the noise is formidable. Ford does augment the natural exhaust sound with some piped-in soundtrack, but who cares? It only makes the whole experience sound amazing.\n\nSave Your Pennies for These Ponies\n\nThe problem starts when you look at how much this whiz-bang technology and sophistication will cost you. The base price for a new 2018 Mustang EcoBoost with a standard manual transmission is $26,485 including destination charge (interestingly, this is almost exactly what my old 1997 Mustang SVT Cobra cost new). Add an automatic transmission for $1,595. Unfortunately, the price quickly climbs from here — if you want Sync 3, a nine-speaker stereo and rear parking sensors, they’re part of a $2,000 package. There are several more packages you can specify as well, including the Performance Package ($2,495 for the EcoBoost, $3,995 for the GT), various wheel and tire packages, the MagneRide suspension, the fancy exhaust, premium audio and more.\n\nYou can add everything up and pay nearly $44,000 for a four-cylinder Mustang, or go nuts and get a loaded GT convertible for more than $58,000. While not as pricey as the track-oriented GT350, it’s still an amazing amount of money for an American pony car. Want the best bang for the buck? Go for an EcoBoost fastback manual-transmission model and specify just one option: the Performance Pack. Cloth seats, no Sync 3, no fancy audio or even backup sensors — but you’ll get a highly entertaining, damned good-looking, 310-hp, turbocharged four-seat sports car for less than $29,000 out the door.\n\nIn defense of the higher price, however, you get a pony car that’s more sophisticated, more capable, better built and better looking than ever before. Either powertrain can hang with cars costing thousands of dollars more from European luxury brands that you wouldn’t normally expect to compete with a Ford. But the new Mustang can and does show those brands its taillights. It’s not just the best Mustang Ford’s ever built, but it might just be the best sports car they’ve ever done.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "We’ve already driven the 2024 Ford Mustang EcoBoost with its turbocharged four-cylinder and the 2024 Mustang GT with its 480-horsepower V-8, but we recently got to drive the car you see here: the 500-hp 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse. It’s the new top-performance trim level of the Mustang, and it offers a more extreme, track-focused take on the Mustang GT. While the Dark Horse’s capability is impressive, what was more surprising is how livable this sports car is in everyday driving, a few trade-offs aside.\n\nRelated: 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse Runs With a Familiar Formula\n\nHow It Drives\n\nFor one, the Mustang Dark Horse rides exceptionally well for a high-performance sports car, and its ride quality is actually better than a lot of mainstream vehicles. It’s not what you’d necessarily expect after seeing the Dark Horse’s suspension changes with the available Dark Horse Handling Package, which is what we tested and includes stiffer springs, low-profile competition tires and bigger sway bars. But the car nonetheless does a good job soaking up bumps and cracks in the road when it’s in its Normal drive mode, and it prevents any harshness from reaching occupants. The Dark Horse comes standard with Ford’s adjustable firmness MagneRide adaptive shocks, and they do a great job here.\n\nThe extra-wide wheels and tires that are part of the Dark Horse Handling Package — the 19-inch wheels are 10.5 inches wide in front and 11 inches wide at the rear — do introduce some less desirable handling traits in everyday driving. The Mustang Dark Horse wiggles side to side a bit when driving over utility covers, and it also wants to follow grooves on the highway. You also hear the sound of sand and pebbles getting hurled against the fender wells after being picked up by the sticky tires. We’ve experienced similar things in previous Mustangs with extra-wide wheels and tires, so while it’s not necessarily unexpected, it’s something you don’t experience in a 2024 Mustang GT.\n\nHowever, if that’s the penalty for the Dark Horse’s quick-reacting steering and overall nimbleness, I’ll take it. The car’s combination of responsive steering and a hunkered down, planted feel gives you a lot of confidence when barreling into corners.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe Dark Horse is one of those cars that you come across every now and then that always seems to be urging you to drive faster — no matter how fast you’re already going. It’s like the devil’s horse is sitting on your shoulder, nudging you to press the gas pedal just a little bit more. And with a 500-hp V-8 under its hood, the Dark Horse has a lot to give, with the V-8 serving up big waves of power accompanied by its ever-present exhaust growl. Even when you’re cruising along at more than 70 mph on the highway, you don’t really feel like you’re moving that fast. It’s a testament to the car’s overall composure and poise.\n\nLike the GT, the Dark Horse comes with a six-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission. The manual transmission, however, is from a different supplier and has different gearing: The GT uses a Getrag manual, but the Dark Horse gets a Tremec unit. Both shifters have short throws, but the Dark Horse’s Tremec manual is a bit more refined, with the stick moving more smoothly from gear to gear.\n\nAlso like the GT, the Dark Horse’s exhaust note is loud and omnipresent — even in the active exhaust system’s Normal setting. You can dial it up even more by choosing its Sport or Track modes, or make it considerably quieter by using the Quiet mode. The bellowing exhaust note fits the Dark Horse, but as in the regular GT, I could see it becoming tiresome in everyday driving.\n\nInterior Needs More Attention\n\nThe Dark Horse’s drivetrain and suspension changes make it an impressive performer, but Ford should have given the interior of this special trim level something to make it feel … special. The unique design cues — things like a thicker flat-bottom steering wheel with suede inserts, blue stitching on various trim pieces and a titanium shift ball on manual-transmission cars — are subtle and don’t significantly differentiate the cabin from a regular GT. And the carbon-fiber-look plastic trim on the dashboard and doors looks even more out of place in the Dark Horse than it does in other 2024 Mustangs.\n\nDriving the Dark Horse provided another chance to test the 2024 Mustang’s available Recaro front bucket seats, and it reinforced my view that they aren’t great for everyday driving. While the seats are comfortable, their large side bolsters get in the way when working the steering wheel back and forth; the backs of my arms were constantly bumping against them.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Ford Mustang GTD: Not a Shortened Religious Epithet, But It May as Well Be\nWhich Trim Level of the 2024 Ford Mustang Should You Buy?\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nResearch the 2024 Ford Mustang\nShop for a 2024 Ford Mustang\nShould You Pony Up for a Dark Horse?\n\nThe Dark Horse is a blast to drive, a car that’ll bring a smile to the face of any enthusiast who likes the feel and sound of a big V-8 engine and traditional sports car agility. The price premium over a GT, however, is significant and will likely give many buyers pause.\n\nWith a starting price of around $61,000 (including destination), the Dark Horse is more than $16,000 costlier than a GT, though in addition to the performance features, you also get convenience features like dual-zone automatic climate control and a B&O premium stereo. That said, it only takes a handful of high-priced options for the Dark Horse’s price to rapidly increase from there; the as-tested price of our Dark Horse Premium model, for instance, was around $77,000. Breathtaking, for sure — but so is the Dark Horse’s performance.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe 2026 Ford Mustang is available in six trim levels: EcoBoost, EcoBoost Premium, GT, GT Premium, Dark Horse and Dark Horse Premium.\nThe 2026 model gets a new ‘80s-throwback FX Package available on the GT Premium trim.\nCoupe and convertible body styles are available.\nBase prices range from $34,315 to $71,070 (all prices include $1,995 destination charge).\n\nWith the Chevrolet Camaro dead and the Dodge Charger Sixpack still en route, shoppers looking for a gasoline-swilling American muscle car have precisely one option at the moment: the 2026 Ford Mustang. But within that single model, many choices remain: coupe or convertible; manual or automatic transmission; four-cylinder engine or V-8 — and, if V-8, 480, 486 or 500 horsepower? For 2026, the Mustang’s base price ranges from $34,315 to $71,070 (all prices include the $1,995 destination charge), and a generously optioned Dark Horse can encroach on $90,000. So, which trim level of the 2026 Ford Mustang is right for you?\n\nRelated: 2024 Ford Mustang GT Review: Stomping Into the Future\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe 2026 Ford Mustang EcoBoost variants are powered by a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine making 350 pounds-feet of torque. The turbo four is only available with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and all Mustangs are rear-wheel drive. It returns an EPA-rated 22/33/26 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nBuyers who want a manual transmission in their Mustang have to opt for a V-8. The Mustang GT’s 5.0-liter generates 480 hp and 415 pounds-feet of torque, or 486 hp and 418 pounds-feet with the optional active exhaust. In the Mustang Dark Horse, the V-8 is tweaked to deliver an even 500 hp and 418 pounds-feet of torque. GT buyers have a no-cost choice between a six-speed manual and a 10-speed automatic transmission, but the manual costs an additional $300 in the Dark Horse. The GT returns 16/24/19 mpg with the automatic transmission and 15/23/18 mpg with the manual, while the Dark Horse is rated at 14/22/17 mpg with either gearbox.\n\nEcoBoost: $34,315\n\nThe entry-level Ford Mustang rides on 18-inch wheels and features keyless entry and start, LED exterior lighting (including sequential taillights) and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Inside, you’ll find manually adjustable cloth seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, six speakers, a 12.4-inch digital instrument cluster and a 13.2-inch touchscreen.\n\nFor the base Mustang EcoBoost, the convertible is $7,800 more than the coupe and also includes active noise cancellation, a nine-speaker sound system and a lockable glove box.\n\nStandard safety equipment on the Mustang includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and steering assist, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high beams and rear parking sensors.\n\nEcoBoost Premium: $38,340\n\nWhile the contents of the Premiums are largely similar between the Mustang’s available engines and body styles, prices vary considerably, from just $1,725 on the EcoBoost convertible to $4,995 on the Dark Horse. On all Mustangs, it includes heated side mirrors, remote start, synthetic leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats with memory settings for the driver, upgraded cabin finishes, aluminum pedals, ambient lighting and a nine-speaker sound system.\n\nFord Co-Pilot360 Assist+ is only available on the Premium trim levels and includes adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, a driver attention monitor and blind spot intervention.\n\nOn the EcoBoost Premium, the convertible adds $5,500.\n\nGT: $48,555\n\nOther than its more powerful engine, the Mustang GT is mostly the same as the EcoBoost; it does, however, have larger brakes and standard black 18-inch wheels. Buyers who want a convertible V-8 must step up to the GT Premium, as the convertible is not available on the base GT.\n\nGT Premium: $53,075\n\nIn addition to the Premium features on the EcoBoost, the GT Premium also gets silver-painted 19-inch wheels, genuine leather upholstery and a heated steering wheel. New for 2026, the GT Premium gets an optional FX Package, which evokes the 1980s’ Fox Body era and comes with unique wheels finished in Oxford White, as well as white badges and exterior accents and plaid seat inserts. On the EcoBoost Premium and GT Premium, the convertible costs $5,500.\n\nDark Horse: $66,075\n\nThe Dark Horse is more than just a GT with a little extra power. It gets an upgraded suspension with a strut-tower brace, unique 19-inch wheels wearing summer performance tires, an active performance exhaust, a rear spoiler, Brembo front brakes and engine oil, transmission and differential coolers. Here, power-adjustable front seats and leather upholstery are standard even on the base trim, which also includes a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system. The Dark Horse and Dark Horse Premium are only available as coupes.\n\nDark Horse Premium: $71,070\n\nThe Dark Horse Premium adds all of the remaining equipment from the other Premium trim levels that isn’t standard on the regular Dark Horse. Ford Co-Pilot360 Assist+ is not available on either Dark Horse.\n\nRead More About the Ford Mustang:\n\n2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse Quick Spin: Impressive Capability, Surprising Civility\nFord Mustang GTD Liquid Carbon Bares It All\n2025 Ford Mustang 60th Anniversary Special Edition Celebrates Rare Milestone\nIs the 2024 Ford Mustang GT a Good Sports Car? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\n2024 Ford Mustang EcoBoost Quick Spin: Same Looks, Less Visceral\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Some versions of the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 don’t drive much differently from an optioned-up Mustang GT, but other Mach 1s could be quite transformative.\n\nVersus the competition: Continual tweaking of the current Mustang platform only highlights how sophisticated and livable it really is compared with the Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger.\n\nThe 2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 returns after a 17-year absence as a turned-up version of the Mustang GT. But there isn’t a single Mach 1 package; depending on the configuration, you can turn the car up a bit or a lot versus a regular Mustang GT. I drove the version that’s turned up a bit, and it’s quite good — and not only because it’s a Mach 1.\n\nRelated: Five-Point-Ohhh! 2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 Is Ultimate 5-Liter Pony Car\n\nWhat Is a Mach 1?\n\nThere’s no simple answer to that question. The Mach 1 aims to be a tweener sitting amid the Mustang GT and Mustang Shelby GT500, taking the place of the Shelby GT350 now that it’s been sent to the glue factory. There are multiple configurations and capabilities, however, so not every Mach 1 will be a replacement for the Shelby GT350 — but it can get pretty close, both in capabilities and in price.\n\nWhat this car is really boils down to this: Are we talking Mach 1 without the Handling Package, or Mach 1 with the Handling Package?\n\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nI drove a Mach 1 without the Handling Package. It was a Premium trim with added Elite and Appearance packages, plus an automatic transmission that rang up the bill to $59,390, including destination charge.\n\nThe entry-level Mach 1 ($54,595) is a smartly configured and capable Mustang, with standard equipment similar to a GT with its optional Performance Package, MagneRide adaptive shock absorbers, and active, adjustable-volume exhaust.\n\nThe Mach 1’s standard transmission is the Tremec 3160 six-speed manual from the GT350, while the GT has a standard Getrag unit. I didn’t drive a manual Mach 1, but in the GT350 the six-speed is buttery smooth and great for quick shifts; the Getrag is pretty clunky.\n\nThe Mach 1 also has unique suspension tuning, power steering, antilock brakes and stability control. Its optional 10-speed automatic transmission has an upgraded torque converter, an additional oil cooler and unique transmission calibration. Oh, and the 5.0-liter V-8 has 480 horsepower instead of 460 thanks to the GT350’s intake manifold and tweakage of the engine’s computer.\n\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nThe Rest of the Mach 1 Includes:\nNineteen-inch wheels that are 9.5 inches wide in the front, 10 inches in the rear — a half-inch wider than those on a GT with Performance Package. The available Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires, however, are the same size as the GT Performance Package, at 255/40R19 up front and 275/40R19 in the back.\nAdditional engine oil cooler\nShelby GT500 rear axle cooling system\nShelby GT500 lower rear diffuser\nShelby GT500 rear suspension toe-link\nNew front aero splitter (22% more downforce than a GT with Performance Package)\nStiffer rear subframe bushings\nStiffer steering I-shaft\nStiffer sway bars\nStiffer front springs\nBrake booster from former Performance Pack Level 2\nHow Does the Mach 1 Drive?\n\nThat’s a lot of setup to say the Mach 1 without the Handling Package and with the 10-speed automatic doesn’t feel all that different on the street from a Mustang GT equipped with the GT Performance Package, magnetic shocks and the 10-speed automatic — which isn’t a bad thing. Thus configured, that Mustang GT is a well-rounded, does-it-all-well-enough car that we’ve found proficient in all areas of dynamic testing: drag strip acceleration, a road course and even light family duty — all with better visibility and daily usability than the Chevrolet Camaro and the tenacity and nimbleness lacking from the Dodge Challenger.\n\nThe Mach 1 straddles a line of aggressiveness with the livable GT Performance Package on one side and the competition-ready Level 2 Performance Package on the other. The Level 2’s ride quality was a bit more “on” all the time, with slightly increased road feel; the Mach 1 is more of a Level 1.5. The GT Performance Package, on the other hand, can be quite relaxed in comfort mode, and the Mach 1 never gets there.\n\nThe Mach 1’s capability and durability are enhanced for track duty, but additional oil coolers and trick aero are not differences you’ll notice unless you’re beating the snot out of a car on a track. And with the same tires found on the regular GT Performance Package and just an imperceivable power boost, it mostly drives like a Mustang GT around town.\n\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nOne of my favorite features Ford made standard in the Mach 1 is its active exhaust with a “quiet mode” setting. It makes a massive difference in the car’s volume, and you can program it to start in quiet mode, allowing for neighborhood-friendly starts. Then, when you’re in Track mode, the exhaust is straight rowdy.\n\nThe car we drove had the optional 10-speed auto, which lets the Mach 1 rip through gears almost like a sport motorcycle; in previous Mustang GT testing with this transmission and the Michelin tires that come standard on the Mach 1, we ran as quickly as 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds and the quarter-mile in 11.9 seconds.\n\nEven with Mach-1-specific tuning, the automatic still has some wonkiness — shift feel can vary from mushy to tire-chirping-ly harsh in the same driving mode — but overall, I’m a fan of how it reacts when the pedal goes to the floor.\n\nMust-Have Mach 1 Appearance Package\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nFor a car that already has a Mach-1-specific grille, hood stripe and wheels, it was another appearance add-on that transformed my test car into an absolute head-turner (as judged by the number of people who reacted to this car in the time I had it). It’s an optional Appearance Package, and it’s available only on the Mach 1’s Premium trim. It adds slick, muted Fighter Jet Gray paint (which I discovered is similar to propane tank gray when I took the Mach 1 to exchange my empty grill tank). It also adds a contrasting orange color to the brake calipers, hood, side stripe and front seats. That color combo — plus optional magnetic gray, split-five-spoke wheels — garnered a lot of attention. It caught me off guard, because at first I saw this as just a Mustang GT with some stickers on it.\n\nThe Mach 1 got a compliment or comment on every trip I took during my week of driving it. The driver of a 1965 Mustang coupe stopped in the middle of the street to check out the Mach 1 in my driveway. One person asked if it was the new electric Mustang — an understandable mix-up considering its Mach-ness — and the owner of a 2016 Mustang GT stopped and asked if I thought they’d make the Tremec standard across all Mustangs because he was unhappy with his Getrag transmission. A group of teenagers hanging in a pool parking lot crowded me while I was trying to finagle my toddler into her child seat to ask if the car was twin-turbocharged. I didn’t get this much attention when I drove the latest Shelby GT500.\n\nWhat Else Can You Get?\n\nMy test car didn’t have it, but there’s also a Mach 1 Handling Package ($3,750). It’s the replacement for the now-discontinued track-ready Performance Pack Level 2, which in our testing approached Shelby GT350-levels of track-ability. On top of the Mach 1’s base equipment, the Handling Package adds revised chassis tuning, plus even wider wheels and racy minimal-tread Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires; they measure 10.5 inches wide in the front (305/30R19 ) and 11 inches wide in the rear (315/30R19). There are also adjustable strut top mounts for more-aggressive alignment options, plus a larger front splitter and rear spoiler that increase downforce 150% over the base GT.\n\nIn the past, we’ve compared the Level 2 package with the GT Performance Package, so the Handling Package really does make this Mach 1 the dial-turned-all-the-way-up option and the most suitable replacement for the GT350. This time around, it comes standard with the Tremec manual transmission and can be optionally equipped with the 10-speed automatic, unlike the manual-only Level 2. The value equation we liked so much with the Level 2 package, however, is gone: A Mach 1 with the Handling Package is a $58,000 car, not a $46,000 one, as was that GT. That’s only marginally less than the $60,000 Shelby GT350.\n\nIs This What the Mach 1 Should Be?\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nCalling this car the Mach 1 seems odd in the current Mustang lineup, considering some versions are a replacement for the discontinued Shelby GT350 and others are lightly worked-over Mustang GTs. There’s no single distinguishing feature like the previous “Shaker” hood scoop, though there is a unique decal package, grille and wheel choice in addition to the mechanical upgrades. I suspect the Handling Package will be transformative, but it’s optional — as is the Appearance Package that really made my Mach 1 stand out.\n\nExcuse my cost-is-no-object daydreaming and ignorance of what Mustang historians think the Mach 1 should be, but I’d like to see a Mach 1 that’s a track-focused car with the Handling and Appearance packages standard and — gasp — the dual-clutch automatic transmission from the GT500. I’ve been blown away by what that DCT does in the GT500, and I think my dream Mach 1 would be an absolute beast — and a totally unique, naturally aspirated track car.\n\nWithout the Handling Package, I think the Mach 1 just isn’t enough more than a Mustang GT with Performance Package, which manages to deliver most of the Mach 1’s experience at a more-affordable price. But what do I know? People geeked out on this car the entire time I was driving it; if that’s what you’re going for, then the Mach 1 (at least with the Appearance Package) won’t disappoint.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCompare The Mustang Shelby GT350’s Specs To The Mach 1\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 Pulls 53 G’s … From Muscle-Car Lovers’ Bank Accounts\nThis Pony’s Goin’ to the Glue Factory: Last Ride for Ford Mustang Shelby GT350\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1: This Ain’t No Electric SUV\n2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt First Drive: A Better Car Than a Tribute\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The motion picture “Bullitt” begins in Chicago in the late 1960s. Coincidentally, so did I; between that and being the only editor who had driven the first two Bullitt-edition Mustangs — a 2001 and 2008 — when they were new, I was a logical choice to attend Ford’s national media drive for the third Ford Mustang Bullitt, held in San Francisco — the city that hosts the bulk of the film and one of the most beloved car chases in cinema history. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: Top 10 Worst Movie Cars\n\nLike the others, the 2019 Mustang Bullitt was inspired by the 1968 Mustang fastback driven by police Lieutenant Frank Bullitt, played by the legendary Steve McQueen. The exact vehicle seen smoking its tires and catching air in the hills of “the city” enjoyed a homecoming of sorts in connection with this event, thanks to its owner, New Jersey-based Sean Kiernan, whose father purchased the car in 1974 and later declined an offer from McQueen himself to buy it back in 1977. Alas, we were not given the option to drive the original hero car.\n\n1968 Ford Mustang movie car and 2019 Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\nA Familiar Feel\n\nWhat I did drive had a familiar feel, as each 2019 Bullitt is fundamentally a Ford Mustang GT Premium equipped with the Performance Package, which we’ve tested extensively, including in a head-to-head against the newer and more aggressive Performance Package Level 2. As such, the Bullitt comes with the PP1’s revised suspension and the option of MagneRide adaptive shock absorbers, which all of the pre-production cars at the event featured. It also comes standard with an active exhaust system through which the modified 5.0-liter V-8 thunders to life, accompanied by a head-on image of the Bullitt Mustang on the standard 12-inch digital instrument panel display, in place of the regular pony logo. (Just how thunderously it starts depends on how you set the exhaust, which includes a Quiet mode and a Quiet Start provision.)\n\n2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nIf you’re a fan of the film who’s not familiar with Mustangs, know that this is a great one. Thanks to about a decade of refinement (but not too much) combined with modern technology, the new Bullitt does a great job of being a performance car that’s more livable than ever from day to day … if you can drive stick. Like Steve’s original, all Bullitts have come exclusively with a manual transmission (this the first six-speed), and it now has an exclusive white cue-ball shift knob to match the movie car. Unlike the movie car’s tall four-on-the-tunnel Hurst shifter, the ’19 Bullitt has a short lever with agreeably short throws. The engineers ensured a satisfying weight by building the laser-etched ball around a copper sphere.\n\n2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nAs in the earlier Bullitts, this one isn’t built to be an ultimate performance variant but does have some mods to set it apart, including the use of the Shelby GT350’s intake manifold, a larger throttle body (87 versus 82 millimeters in diameter) and an open air box. The freer flowing induction and active exhaust allow a new calibration that adds 20 horsepower to the peak for 480 hp total and broadens the torque band substantially. Most notably, it’s good for about 12 pounds-feet more at 2,500 rpm and a peak — unchanged at 420 pounds-feet — that comes about 100 rpm later, roughly 4,700 rpm, followed by pretty consistent superiority over the regular GT all the way to redline.\n\n1968 Ford Mustang fastback from “Bullitt” | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nI’m not going to tell you I could feel the torque differences versus the regular GT because the hills of California were a greater variable compared with the slow-death flatness around Cars.com’s Chicago home where I drove other GTs. But there’s more than enough torque even for the steep streets seen in the movie, such as Taylor and Filbert, where I resisted the urge to catch some air and took frequent advantage of one of the transmission’s modern aids: hill hold. I also found myself using and abusing the crap out of another technological marvel, automatic rev matching that gooses the engine to rev up and mesh smoothly with the transmission each time you downshift. It’s a feature many manual fans like me view as the ultimate cop-out … and admit loving, especially as the music from the Bullitt’s short, matte-black tailpipes echoed off row houses reprising the role they played in 1968.\n\n2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe Bullitt sounds a little different from a regular GT, even one with the active exhaust, thanks to the open air box up front and additional burble graciously programmed into the engine management. By the time I was done bellowing through tunnels, San Francisco was probably ready to send me back to Chicago (if not for that reason, then definitely for calling the town “Frisco”).\n\nThe hills proved how rewarding a classic naturally aspirated, torquey V-8 can be, as well as how effective, if slightly grabby, the Brembo brakes are, which bite super-high in the pedal travel and then proceed to grant more stopping power than the Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires can always match. On canyon roads, the Bullitt hunkers down and sticks admirably unless you get on the gas too hard, but it remains controllable and surprisingly comfortable — especially in a straight line — where the shocks remain soft regardless of the mode you choose. I employed Sport Plus mode and its firmer suspension almost all the time, a departure from home, where the pavement is less forgiving.\n\nIf the torque changes were hard to confirm, there’s no question the Bullitt’s horsepower climbs all the way to redline, where the regular GT’s peters out at 7,000 rpm. Combine this performance with the intoxicating sound, and you find yourself getting more acquainted with the rev limiter than you do in the average manual.\n\n2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nWhile I’m praising the engineers, more kudos to them for going the extra mile for all manual 2019 Ford Mustangs by incorporating a sensor in the shifter itself. As a result, the prominent gear indicator inside the digital tachometer registers the moment the stick enters a gate rather than a second or two after you release the clutch, as in many stick-shift vehicles. (Look, if you’re going to indicate the gear, it has to be immediate or why bother?)\n\nThe Exclusives\n\nApart from the powertrain tweaks and other features mentioned, Bullitt exclusives include the Dark Highland Green paint, which has more metal flake than in the past, reportedly necessary to make the lines pop. Black is the only other paint option. The grille openings are the same size as the GT’s, but the upper grille is uninterrupted by vertical members and is ringed in chrome to emulate the ’68, and the lower grille’s mesh extends to fill the opening. The wheels are … inspired by the original’s and carry on the chrome ring of earlier tributes. The leather seats have subtle green stitching, and the Bullitt lettering and/or crosshair logo appear on the trunk, a strut-tower brace under the hood, the steering wheel, the door sills and a dashboard plaque bearing each car’s unique chassis number. Less adjustable Recaro front sport seats are one of three options along with MagneRide and the Bullitt Electronics Package that provides a memory driver’s seat and side mirrors, ambient lighting, navigation, a new B&O Play audio system and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\n2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe Ford Mustang Bullitt starts at $47,590, including a destination charge, and hits $52,980 loaded. Production is technically limited, but Ford won’t give a number and says the Bullitt will continue through the 2020 model year. Between the similarities to a GT Premium PP1 and the manual transmission, I suspect the build will be limited by demand, not production.\n\nThe Best Bullitt?\n\nChoosing the best Bullitt edition is difficult because they all have their strengths and weaknesses. The 2019 is unquestionably the best to drive, as it should be. (I think the current Mustang on which it’s based should be frozen in time because they can’t make it any better without making it too slick and less a Mustang.) On one level, its drivability makes this Bullitt the least like Dearborn’s best effort from 1968. Conversely, the 2001 unfathomably was still built on the dodgy Fox platform that made its debut in 1979, and had dynamics and refinement closer to vehicles of an earlier era. The 2008’s styling was based on the old fastback, so its profile is truer to the movie car that inspired it, and its nose is the closest, with widely spaced round headlights above the turn signals rather than inboard of them like the 2001, flanking a similarly shaped broad grille under an overhanging hood.\n\n2001 Ford Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nFrankly, the new Bullitt is almost as far from the movie car as the 2001 was, with angular headlight clusters extending way back in the fenders, and a return to the red brake calipers that appeared in ’01 but vanished in ’08. The 2019’s sole exclusive claim to authenticity seems to be a white cue-ball shifter in place of the previous tributes’ metallic finish. Ultimately, where the 2019 lost me was with its new 19-inch wheels, which are nice enough on their own merit, showing off giant brake rotors and conspicuous red Brembo-branded calipers, but they simply depart too much from the original mag wheels, which were a highlight. Granted, 15-inch wheels simply don’t fly in 2019, but the 2008’s 18s at least held onto the classic shape to a degree, as did the 2001’s 17-inchers. It’s possible throwback rims would look wrong on the more modern 2019, but to me that just reinforces that this one isn’t the ultimate Bullitt tribute — and probably should be the last.\n\n2008 Ford Mustang Bullitt | Cars.com photo by Ian Merritt\n\nMy pick for the distinction of best Bullitt tribute is the 2008. Though it was disappointingly slab-tailed (ahead of some changes that came later in its generation), neither of the other tributes capture the original’s haunchy and stylistic rear end anyway. It’s the right mix of baked-in similarities (profile, nose) and wise choices where flexibility was an option (wheel design, dark calipers).\n\nViewers Beware\n\nAs for the film, if you’ve never seen it, it’s worth a viewing. Like many classic movies, it seems slow by today’s standards, but it’s not a hindrance. It takes place in 1968, a year with enough political and cultural turmoil to make 2018 look like a reality TV show, but none of that is in the film. The only tragedy of the era reflected in “Bullitt” is an overabundance of jazz music.\n\nThe fact that the character’s name is Frank Bullitt suggests a hokiness that’s thankfully absent. It’s a no-nonsense production with understated performances and a relatively simple storyline that ends where a modern film would just get started, for better or for worse. Just bear in mind two things, car fans: First, it’s not a car-chase movie; it’s a movie with one very long car chase scene in it. (The other pursuit, itself similarly innovative at the time, was a foot chase on an active airport runway.) Second, what passed for a landmark car chase in 1968 seems quaint but for the fact that the lead actor does much of his own driving. Far more inventive car chases have come since, often to a fault. But it’s still engaging to see the cars storming over the hills of San Francisco in the days before computer-generated animation and hearing the unflattering bang of their landings (Hollywood would do much better today) to a backdrop of sweet V-8 music and McQueen double-clutching each shift.\n\nWhile you’re at it, keep an eye on the bad guys’ black Dodge Charger, which presumably has four conventional wheels yet manages to lose five hubcaps over the course of the pursuit — clearly. (Some claim it loses eight, less clearly, but I’m not going to pore over this thing like it’s the freakin’ Zapruder film.)\n\nThe Remake\n\nIt’s surprising a movie that turns 50 in October has inspired three tribute vehicles but no remakes, despite one threat. My colleagues and I attempted to cast such a reboot, and the beloved McQueen — desired by women, admired by men — proves difficult to replace. If not Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise seems to be the iconic American actor who’s also known for doing his own stunts in the name of authenticity, but McQueen’s authenticity was viewed as extending beyond the set, a charge we’ve never heard leveled against Cruise. Keanu? Maybe. Fassbender? Not American. Gosling? I’m not as sold on the guy as some are, and I fear he’d do all his own driving but constantly look at his feet. All of these guys might seem too old, but old isn’t what it used to be. McQueen was 38 in 1968, but I would have guessed 48. The ultimate test: Would any of these jokers qualify, as Steve did, as the “King of Cool”?\n\nLet’s not kid ourselves, folks. The 2019 reboot would star Charlize Theron as Frankie Bullitt. One of those other stiffs would play her boyfriend. Maybe. Charlize was born in South Africa, but at a time when her namesake Mustang is built with 56 percent domestic parts (2018 data) and has a manual transmission with a country of origin listed as China, she’s American enough, and she’s proven to be something of a badass in “Mad Max” and “Atomic Blonde” who appeals to all genders.\n\nLike the 2019 Mustang Bullitt, a 2019 film remake would move faster. It would be slicker and more refined. Jumping cars would land with a more agreeable sound, and we’d probably learn more about the Chicago mob and what happened before and after the snapshot 1968’s “Bullitt” covers. Would it be better than the original? Nope. But at least there would be less jazz.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2014 about the 2015 Ford Mustang. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nFord gets it right with the 2015 Mustang, thoroughly upgrading the historic muscle car inside and out while providing a welcome dose of the latest technology.\n\nFor 2015, Ford has completely redesigned its iconic pony car, an event that’s happened only a handful of times in the car’s 50-year history. This time, it’s produced a visually trimmer, meaner sports car with a new mission: take the Mustang mystique to global markets.\n\nFord has sold the Mustang overseas before, but this new one — with its fully independent suspension, optional turbocharged four-cylinder engine and dramatically improved build quality — is made to challenge not only American competitors at home, but foreign coupes on foreign shores.\n\nThe 2015 model is a major redo compared with the outgoing 2014 (compare the two here), with new powertrains, a new interior, new technology and more. Yet a new Chevrolet Camaro is on the way and Dodge has just updated the 2015 Challenger. Is the new Mustang enough of an update to regain its status as king of the pony-car hill? I’ve driven two of the three powertrains available in the 2015 Mustang — the EcoBoost four-cylinder and the big V-8 (the V-6 has not yet been made available to sample) — and here’s how they stack up.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAt first glance, you’d be forgiven for thinking not much has changed from the old Mustang to the new one. The jury’s still out as to whether Ford went far enough in updating the car, but when spotted next to an outgoing model on the highway the subtle differences and styling improvements become obvious. The ’15 also adds many design themes from non-muscle-car Fords, like the hexagonal grille and lidded headlights, butched up for muscle-car duty.\n\nComparisons are still being made, however, with the Ford Taurus and Fusion sedans, and it’s certainly possible to see those cars’ influence. The Mustang’s best angle may be the rear three-quarters, where the svelte and sloped tri-bar LED taillights look absolutely fantastic and the muscular wheel arches become much more prominent. The roofline and window openings are also subtly different from the 2014 model. The overall look is conservative, but nobody will mistake it for anything other than a Mustang.\n\nHow It Drives\nI’ve driven the Mustang on several occasions, first on canyon roads around Los Angeles and most recently at a private racetrack in rural Illinois. Along with the carryover V-6 and V-8 engines — both with revised power output — comes a new entry: a turbocharged, 2.3-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engine that’s also found (in slightly less-powerful form) under the hood of the Lincoln MKC crossover. In the Mustang, it makes 310 horsepower and 320 pounds-feet of torque — extremely impressive numbers for a four-cylinder engine.\n\nConsider: This is more horsepower than the 1996 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra’s 4.6-liter V-8 pumped out, and it’s said to get 32 mpg on the highway. That’s serious progress, folks. Even though the Mustang EcoBoost I drove came with a six-speed automatic transmission, it was highly enjoyable. Punch the push-button start, now standard in all Mustangs, and the turbo four growls to life with a surprisingly throaty rasp. You’ll never mistake it for the V-8 in the GT, but it has a certain aural charm all its own. It should be noted, however, that all the sound you hear isn’t coming from the engine — it’s supplemented by a prerecorded soundtrack that’s piped through the speakers. Ford does this because the turbocharged engine is simply too quiet for the Mustang; all the sound insulation and the turbocharger itself act to quiet the exhaust noise to the point that it simply doesn’t sound like a proper sports car. The piped-in music fixes that, and if you didn’t know it wasn’t live, you wouldn’t be able to tell. Just turn it on, snick the automatic transmission into Drive, give it gas and prepare to be surprised — this thing is quick.\n\nVarious publications have pegged the Mustang EcoBoost’s zero-to-60 mph time in the mid-5-second range — not too shabby for a car this heavy. In fairness, I should point out that all the cars in this class are heavy, and of the trio of Camaro, Challenger and Mustang, the Ford is the lightest. The automatic transmission kicks down noticeably when you give it some gas, but in around-town driving it’s extremely flexible, with a broad torque curve. Get out into the canyons and flip the toggle switch to engage Sport mode, though, and the Mustang EcoBoost comes alive. (It’s one of four standard selectable drive modes.)\n\nThe systems that Sport mode affects, such as steering effort and transmission shift aggressiveness, can also be independently adjusted. In Sport, steering feel firms up noticeably, throttle response gets more rapid and the transmission becomes amazingly precise. In short, it becomes remarkably fun to drive. Oddly, the same cannot be said on the track. The EcoBoost Mustang some of my colleagues drove there did not exhibit the same kind of spirit as the one I drove on twisty streets, leading us to wonder whether the EcoBoost is simply better-suited to real-world driving than track work — at least with the automatic transmission.\n\nThe suspension — now all independent, front and rear — keeps the Mustang solidly planted. With the EcoBoost’s optional 18-inch wheels, ride quality is superb, but it’s less so when the sport suspension and the GT’s optional 19-inch wheels come into play. The tuning should impress even European drivers who have long considered American cars to be rubbish. Unlike four-cylinder Mustangs of the past, buyers can check the option for the 2015 EcoBoost and not regret their decision in the slightest.\n\nOf course, the GT — with its 435-hp V-8 — is more of everything. More noise, more thrust, more ability — but also more weight and more money. It doesn’t feel quite as agile as the EcoBoost, but what it lacks in fancy moves it makes up for in brute force and V-8 audio bliss. The Getrag six-speed manual transmission has clean, easy shifts, but the clutch is fairly heavy; driving it through stop-and-go Los Angeles traffic has to be one of Dante’s circles of hell.\n\nThe GT also brings bigger brakes that are firmer but less easy to modulate than those on the standard EcoBoost; they’re great for bleeding off speed before turning into a corner, but not as great when you’re just trying to negotiate rush hour. For some people, the V-8 is essential to the pony-car experience, and I understand that thinking — it’s visceral and exciting and something of a tradition. But for the first time, a lesser motor in the Mustang may be just as entertaining, thanks to a far more balanced overall package.\n\nThat said, on the track the V-8 GT is just crazy amounts of fun. Instant torque-on-demand means you can steer with either the wheel in your hands or the pedal under your right foot, your choice. The two powertrains I tested create Mustangs with two very different personalities. If you intend to drive yours on a track often, the V-8 GT might be a better choice, but if you simply want an agile sports car that can make your commute through the back roads more entertaining, the EcoBoost version is the one to choose.\n\nFuel economy varies for each powertrain depending on which transmission you opt for — the base V-6 with a manual transmission is rated 17/28/21 mpg city/highway/combined, climbing to 19/28/22 mpg with the automatic. The EcoBoost four-cylinder is more powerful than the V-6 yet is rated higher: 22/31/26 mpg with the stick-shift, 21/32/25 mpg with the automatic. Of course, the big V-8 isn’t quite so frugal, rated 15/25/19 mpg with the manual, 16/25/19 with the automatic. That’s about dead even with comparable V-8-equipped Camaros and Challengers. Comparing the turbocharged four-cylinder Mustang with the V-6 Camaro and Challenger, however, gives the advantage to the Mustang, which is why everyone expects to see a four-cylinder Camaro in the not-too-distant future.\n\nInterior\nFord has done considerable work on the Mustang’s interior, and one absent feature should send cheers throughout the automotive world: There isn’t a single touch-sensitive control panel anywhere, aside from the central LCD touch-screen. Quite the opposite, in fact: Ford has introduced toggle switches along the base of the center console for hazard lights, stability control, steering effort adjustment and the Drive Select mode function.\n\nThe new Mustang’s interior combines the best of two competitors — the neat retro styling touches of the Camaro with the roomier environment of the Dodge Challenger. Like that car, the Mustang has the width and headroom to keep bigger drivers happy, with decent forward visibility thanks to a long, sculpted hood stretching out before you. More surprising is how good visibility is over your shoulder: the long side windows have been extended since the outgoing model, eliminating the little quarter windows and noticeably improving visibility to the rear and sides.\n\nThe base model’s seats are supportive and comfortable, with Recaro seats an option for performance-minded buyers. But the Recaros have some issues: They’re not comfortable, largely due to their limited adjustability, they’re not power-operated, and their wide shoulder supports make a new lever in the Mustang — located in the top middle of the front seatback and used to fold it forward for entry into the rear seats — completely unusable. You simply can’t reach it from outside the car, making me wonder if anyone even tested this feature before production started. You’d be better off sticking with the power-adjustable, non-sport seats. Of course, access to the backseat isn’t terribly important, anyway, as it remains too tiny for adult use. It might work for pre-teen children.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nFord’s Sync system is standard, but MyFord Touch is optional only on higher trims. That system brings a big touch-screen to the center console, within easy reach of driver and passenger. It’s familiar fare from Ford and works quite well — even the voice commands that used to be a problem. A standard “Track Apps” suite of programs allows the driver to adjust engine, steering and transmission tuning between Normal, Sport, Eco and Track modes, while a “line-lock” launch-control feature also comes standard, enabling drag-strip style starts by braking the front wheels and letting the rear tires spin and heat up. Track Apps is similar to the Performance Pages app found in Dodge’s new Challengers and Chargers, and it’s both fun and useful.\n\nCargo & Storage\nStorage has been improved in the new Mustang, both up front and in the trunk. More thought has gone into it, too. The front cupholders have been relocated closer to the passenger and pushed farther back to minimize stick-shift interference. The door pockets are deeper, as is the glove compartment, which now has a knee airbag built right into the glove box door. The trunk is larger, with a bigger and lower opening that now enables it to accommodate two sets of golf clubs. It’s not as big as the Challenger’s massive trunk, but it’s more commodious than the Camaro’s single-duffel-bag capacity. The Mustang brings 13.5 cubic feet of trunk space, versus just 11.3 cubic feet in the Camaro. The Challenger, which is essentially a short-wheelbase, two-door Charger sedan, beats everyone with a voluminous 16.2 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe Mustang’s redesign also brought a change in its electrical systems, which has enabled Ford to add available advanced features like blind-spot warning, forward collision alert and adaptive cruise control, plus standard additional airbags, including the aforementioned passenger knee airbag that’s mounted in the glove box door. The Mustang was too new to have been crash-tested as of publication. See all the Mustang’s standard and optional safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Mustang spans a wide range of prices, starting at $24,425 (including destination) for a V-6-powered fastback with a manual transmission. A convertible model is also available, with the least expensive version just edging under 30 grand, at $29,925. The cheapest EcoBoost-equipped four-cylinder Mustang comes in at $25,995, but to get that engine in a convertible you have to shell out for the EcoBoost Premium trim, which starts at $35,495. The V-8 comes in the GT, starting at $32,925. The most expensive Mustang is a loaded GT Premium convertible with a special 50th Anniversary appearance package that costs more than $50,000.\n\nThe performance deal of the decade may just be the EcoBoost coupe with a $1,995 Performance Package that adds bigger brakes, 19-inch wheels, a gauge pack for the interior, a 3.55 limited-slip rear axle, a larger radiator and the sport suspension. For around the same price as a loaded Scion FR-S or Honda Accord coupe, you’ll get a car that can run rings around either of them at any track day, and is far more comfortable and spacious to boot. Option a Mustang up your way here.\n\nThe Mustang’s competitors are just as legendary as the Ford. This generation of the Chevrolet Camaro is on its last year — due for replacement for the 2016 model year — but constant upgrades to packages and performance trims have made it the better-selling car for a while now. It’s not nearly as comfortable or nice inside as the new Mustang, and visibility out of it is atrocious. But in ZL1 guise it’s a performance monster — and has some of the only comfortable Recaro seats in existence.\n\nThe Dodge Challenger just got a makeover for 2015, too, and it’s considerably improved from its previous incarnation. Easily as nice inside as the new Mustang, it’s even bigger inside and out (you can fit three child-safety seats in the back of a Challenger), has more powerful engines (Hellcat!), plenty of retro style, and comparably good fuel economy in V-6 trim. What it does not have is a convertible model, much to many sun enthusiasts’ dismay. Less-conventional competitors might be the aforementioned Subaru BRZ or Hyundai Genesis coupe, or even the front-wheel-drive Honda Accord coupe. They’re all similar in price but not in performance, making the Mustang a better value than any of them. Compare the Mustang to its competition here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ford Mustang?\n\nThe Ford Mustang is a rear-wheel-drive, four-seat sports car that goes head-to-head with the Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger. It’s available in coupe and convertible body styles and five main trims: EcoBoost, EcoBoost Premium, GT, GT Premium and Mach 1. Ford previously offered the high-performance Shelby GT500, but that version has been discontinued for 2023. \n\nThe EcoBoost is powered by a 310-horsepower, turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine; an optional High Performance Package boosts output to 330 hp. The GT comes with a 450-hp, 5.0-liter V-8, and the Mach 1 has a 470-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. All engines can be paired with a six-speed manual transmission or a 10-speed automatic.\n\nThe Mustang coupe offers 17 cubic feet of trunk space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Ford Mustang?\n\nOther than the discontinuation of the high-performance Shelby GT500, the Mustang carries over unchanged for 2023. A redesigned 2024 Mustang is slated to go on sale in the summer of 2023.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Ford Mustang Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n17-inch aluminum wheels\nManual air conditioning\nPush-button start\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nPower-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nRear parking sensors\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2023 Ford Mustang?\n\nThe Mustang hits all the right retro buttons for muscle car enthusiasts, and with a wide range of performance options, this venerable pony car is as appealing as ever. It delivers style and powerful acceleration — especially with its available V-8 engines. Granted, the ride in performance models is on the firmer side, and the backseat is best for kids or extra luggage. When it comes to bang for your buck, though, the Mustang remains a thrilling choice. If you want fresher styling and more up-to-date technology features, you might want to wait for the redesigned 2024 Mustang, but it will almost certainly be more expensive.",

      "expert_review": "When you think Mustang, you probably don’t think about a turbocharged four-cylinder. The original pony car may have rounded into a full-fledged sports car that we can reasonably pit against the best sports coupes out there, but it’s still muscular at its core.\n\nRelated: 2020 Ford Mustang EcoBoost 2.3L High Performance Pack: Fantastic Four\n\nBut Ford does offer a different take on the Mustang as its base model, serving it up with a turbocharged four-cylinder (instead of a V-8) that’s good for hijinks of its own. And for the 2020 model year, the Mustang EcoBoost adds a new High Performance Package that promises to add even more fun.\n\nFord already offered an EcoBoost Performance Package for the 2019 Mustang, and the HPP builds on it. Both offer a 3.55:1 ratio limited-slip rear axle, 19-inch wheels, additional gauges, larger brakes, a rear wing on fastback models, heavy-duty front springs, a thicker rear sway bar and unique chassis tuning. That’s quite a list already, but the HPP also adds more styling details, active performance exhaust and, most important, a new engine. I headed to Sausalito, Calif., just north of San Francisco, to see how much performance the new package actually adds. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nNew PoweRS\n\nThough the new engine is a turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder like the one found in the regular EcoBoost Mustang, don’t get the two mixed up: The HPP’s 2.3-liter, borrowed from the Focus RS hatchback, adds a larger turbocharger and radiator in this application, putting out 330 horsepower and 350 pounds-feet of torque. That’s 20 more horsepower than you get out of the Mustang’s regular EcoBoost engine, but it’s also 20 less than you get in the Focus RS.\n\nThe new engine also puts out power differently than the standard engine. Ford says it has a “broader torque curve that delivers 90 percent of peak torque between 2,500 and 5,300 rpm” and that “horsepower holds stronger up to the 6,500-rpm redline.” That also indicates that the power comes on a little bit later than it does with the standard engine (5,500 rpm), which actually feels a bit peppier at lower rpm, like there’s a bit more instant torque to be had.\n\nThis gives the new engine a bit of a learning curve. The first part of the morning, I struggled to keep the revs high enough to really hit the engine’s sweet spot around 3,500 to 4,000 rpm. Flipping the Mustang into Sport or Sport Plus mode with their more aggressive throttle mapping makes it easier to hold the engine in the power band. Once you get the hang of it, the difference is noticeable — and it’s not just the 20 extra horses. The Mustang HPP pulls, pulls and pulls some more, continuing to pour on speed as the needle approaches the redline. And it’s fun in a way that makes you want to find open road to rip through over and over again.\n\n2021 Ford Mustang EcoBoost with High Performance Package | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nWhich Transmission?\n\nThe Mustang EcoBoost HPP has the same transmission options, a six-speed manual or a 10-speed automatic. Because of the way the engine behaves, it’s paramount that the transmission works with you to keep the engine in its happy place. I drove both automatic and manual variants, finding a clear winner between the two choices: the manual.\n\nThe 10-speed automatic, which I should note I did like while reviewing the 2018 EcoBoost Mustang, gets a bit lost in this application. With the RS engine’s different torque band and an emphasis on maintaining higher revs, the transmission gets a big bogged down and short-shifts you a bit when you want it to hold onto the gears longer. Being able to choose the gears yourself with the manual lets you get more out of the engine and makes the car a lot more fun to drive.\n\nThe other good news: Opting for the manual also saves you $1,595.\n\n2021 Ford Mustang EcoBoost with High Performance Package | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nHandling Package Pluses\n\nThe Mustang EcoBoost HPP also adds grippier Pirelli P-Zero summer tires that, along with the suspension changes, gives the car good athleticism. Ride quality is still pretty good, especially on well-kept roads, where the Mustang glides nicely. But those who want to extract the most performance from the Mustang should add the available EcoBoost Handling Package for $1,995.\n\nFor that, you get an impressive set of added equipment: wider Pirelli Corsa4 tires, the braking system from the GT Performance Pack 1, a Torsen 3.55:1 limited-slip rear axle and, most notably, a MagneRide adaptive damping system. The Torsen setup is better, notably because it is able to mechanically send more torque to the wheel with grip rather than the electronic-braking-based system that’s standard.\n\nThe addition of MagneRide had the most effect of these changes. The system is magic and, when combined with the grippier tires, makes the Mustang come alive even more. This is especially true in the sportier drive modes where the suspension dials up the firmness. If you want to make the Mustang feel at its most agile, this is the way to do it — and it even holds handling advantages over the GT, since it weighs around 250 pounds less. The nose really dances with a deft touch, and knowing you have bigger brakes and those tires just gives a driver added confidence.\n\nIf you’re opting in for the HPP and its $4,995 price already, I think the EcoBoost Handling Package is a must. It might be worth it for the suspension alone, but toss in all of the other upgrades and it’s a no-brainer.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Ford Mustang EcoBoost 2.3L High Performance Pack Preview: What a Nice RS Gets You\nAll the Pretty Horses: 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Unleashes 760 HP\n2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Video: The Ultimate Mustang Arrives\n2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt First Drive: A Better Car Than a Tribute\nGT Substitute?\n\nEach of the variants I drove topped $40,000, which puts them over the price of a GT by a good margin. One of them, with the automatic transmission, handling package and Recaro seats among other options, pushed all the way up to $45,160; that’s quite a bit of change when you consider that you can get a Mustang GT with Performance Pack 2 for only $45,225.\n\nThe four-cylinder will offer you some fuel savings compared to the V-8, with the HPP and the manual transmission it returns an EPA-estimated 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined, which outpaces the V-8’s 15/24/18 mpg with the manual. For the eco-minded, that might be enough of a selling point to sway you in one direction or the other.\n\nBut if you have your heart set on the GT and its big V-8, I don’t think that the EcoBoost with the HPP can change your mind. That’ll get reinforced after you hear the exhaust note from the new active exhaust system. The standard EcoBoost doesn’t sound great, but at least it’s not so loud that it bothers you. The active exhaust is no friend to the HPP engine, either; it makes it sound coarse and unpleasant, in stark contrast to the wonderful soundtrack provided by the GT’s 5.0-liter V-8.\n\nBut if you want a nimble Mustang that puts an emphasis on handling, offers better fuel economy and remains rewarding to drive, then the HPP is right up your alley. It’s a fun car to drive that rewards you as you learn to drive it better.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It was a dreary morning. If the sun was going to make one of its rare appearances, it was still at least an hour from debut. Still, traffic was heavy from the wee-hour workers on their way to punch a clock.\n\nWe swung onto the tollway entrance ramp and plodded along the concrete circle that leads to a coin booth. Reaching the end of the ramp, we looked into the rearview mirror and saw a pack of vehicles approaching. The pack seemed hell bent on keeping the pickup truck at the end of the merge lane and off their treasured pavement.\n\nFiguring our 40 cents was just as good as theirs, we pressed the EEE loaferagainst the accelerator. The merge lane was transformed into a quarter-mile strip. The Ford F-150 truck leapt down the lane and into the main roadway. Thepack of vehicles intent on keeping the pickup a safe distance behind them was a pack of quickly diminishing headlights visible only in our rearview mirror.\n\nThe pack found they had been struck by Lightning. That wasn’t just any Fordpickup the pack tried to embarrass; it was a Ford F-150 with a beefed-up 240-horsepower version of Ford’s current 200-h.p., 5.8-liter, V-8.\n\nWith refinements to the regular pickup, Ford converted the workhorse F-150 into the F-150 Lightning that will accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 7.5 seconds, yet still tow a 5,000-pound boat. With a Lightning underfoot, younever again have to worry about being left sputtering in the merge lane.\n\nLightning is one of two new entries from Ford Motor Co.’s almost equally asnew Special Vehicle Team. SVT is a task force or, in Detroit vernacular, a “skunk works,” whose mission is to bring to market limited-production, high-performance versions of regular production models-cars, trucks or utilityvehicles that “stand apart from mainstream products with improved accelerationand handling.”\n\nIn layman’s terms, Ford felt it was appropriate to offer a series of low-volume, high-profit niche vehicles for those who gauge a vehicle’s worth by its horsepower.\n\nThe first two niche vehicles from the SVT stable are the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Cobra. Both go on sale late this month. SVT promises more, and based on consumer comments, we hope a V-8 powered Explorer utility vehicle, a convertible Mark VIII and a true high-performance version of the subcompact Escort GT will appear soon, too.\n\nJust don’t look for a Corvette or a Viper from SVT, said spokesman Scott Sweeney.\n\n“SVT won’t bring a vehicle to market that isn’t profitable,” he said as thereason it will refrain from coming up with vehicles designed solely to build an image that will draw traffic into the showroom but not dollars into the treasury.\n\nAnd while profit is a motivator, Sweeney said it will be done with moderation.\n\n“You won’t see any $10,000 or $15,000 premiums tacked onto the vehicles. With Cobra and Lightning, you have specialty performance vehicles for only $2,500 over the regular s ticker price,” he said.\n\nThat puts Cobra at $19,900 and Lightning at $21,655.\n\nIn keeping with the theme of limited-edition niche vehicles, only 5,000 Cobras and 10,000 Lightnings will be built between now and the arrival of the all-new Mustang in February 1994 as a 1995 model and the all-new F-Series pickup in the fall of 1994 as a ’95. New Cobras and new Lightnings after that?Maybe.\n\nWe had the opportunity to test-drive both high-performance niche vehicles.\n\nCobra is powered by a 235-h.p. version of Ford’s 205-h.p., 5-liter, V-8 engine. It is teamed with only 5-speed manual transmission. Lightning is powered by the 240-h.p. version of the 5.8-liter, V-8 engine. It is teamed with only 4-speed automatic.\n\nLots of power in both, but you will pay a price. Little did the pack disappearing behind us on the tollway, for example, realize that the bolt of Lightning that had just humiliated them was now parked ahead at the oasis taking nourishment at the fuel pump. While soothing the ego, you savage the wallet.\n\nThe Lightning has dual gas tanks holding 34.7 and 18.2 gallons. You need both. A button on the dash allows you to switch from one tank to the other. That button may wear out before the Lightning does. The official EnvironmentalProtection Agency rating is 12 miles per gallon city/18 m.p.g. highway. Ratherthan measure mileage in gallons, fuel consumed is computed as a tank a day.\n\nLightning is a kick to drive, providing you never wander too far from a gaspump. Acceleration is swift. To ensure you get the full effect of a 240-h.p. V-8 in a full-size pickup, the dual exhausts (with four catalytic converters to keep emissions in check; the regular F-150 has two) have been tuned to growl when you tap the pedal.\n\nTo the SVT team’s credit, it could have focused on bolting from 0 to 60 at the expense of ride and handling. After all, the Chevrolet Corvette has provenfor years that there are people who will sacrifice kidneys and bladder in the interest of speed.\n\nBut Lightning’s suspension is finely honed. You see the scenery move vertically when you pass over the bumps in the road, but you aren’t jostled and your hands don’t fight the steering wheel to maintain control. Ride and handling was much like that of the Pontiac Bonneville SLE we recently drove. And that is a compliment.\n\nWide supportive seats with side bolsters help isolate you from road harshness while holding you in place in sharp or sudden maneuvers. Lightning has such advanced road manners that about the only load worthy of resting in the rear bed would be designer bales of hay. To plow snow with this vehicle would be sacrilegious.\n\nJust so you don’t confuse the Lightning with the F-150 truck, the seats carry “Lightning” wording, the side panels of the cargo bed display “Lightning” decals and the front bumper incorporates an air dam and fog lights. It’s a clean, simplistic package that lets the 240 horses do the talking without lots of bells and whistles. Had Ford come up with a Lightning 10 years ago, it probably would have welded 6-foot-long metal lightning bolts to the roof and flashing neon signs to the doors.\n\nStandard equipment in the Lightning includes power brakes and steering, rear-wheel antilock brakes (at 240-h.p., four-wheel ABS would be appreciated),bucket seats, power driver’s seat, power windows and locks, storage console with dual cupholders, leather-wrapped steering wheel, air conditioning, AM-FM stereo with clock, cruise control and tilt steering.\n\nWith Cobra, the SVT’s mission was to “refine those virtues inherent to every V-8 powered Mustang: A favorable power-to-weight ratio and the responsive handling characteristics exclusive to a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.”\n\nOur gripe here is that Ford gave a new soul (0 to 60 m.p.h. in 5.7 seconds)to an old body that soon will be replaced. Of course, one way to get consumersto take an old b ody off your hands is to inject some life into it. But Mustangwas aged enough to need more than just a sip at the fountain of youth; it could use a bath.\n\nThe other gripe is that Cobra is offered with 5-speed manual only. Because only 5,000 will be built before the next generation Mustang appears, Ford can be forgiven for being picky about who buys its car.\n\nThe beauty of this beast is not just the 30-h.p. boost in the 5-liter, V-8,but also the smooth ride and sure-footed handling. Past Mustangs, at least those dating back to the original, typically acted like a ‘Vette, you paid forquickness with a grueling ride and unruly handling. Seems SVT is backing up its boast with the new Cobra to provide performance vehicles that stick to theroad.\n\nThe Cobra, which began life as a GT before SVT tinkered with the engine andperformance tuned the suspension (from revising the anti-roll bars to adding 17-inch wheels) rates kudos for the ride and handling Ford long has prom ised but seldom delivered in its “pony” car.\n\nHats off, too, to SVT for a smooth 5-speed manual and lightweight clutch movement. Too often when a muscular engine is added to a car the engineers deem it necessary to add a clutch so stiff that you mutilate a hamstring in getting from first to second.\n\nBut Ford and SVT are on the spot. They’ve come up with a pair of vehicles in which the ride, handling and pep complement the performance styling. That means folks are going to have high expectations for that next generation car, truck, van or utility vehicle SVT puts its tattoo on.\n\nThat’s the kind of challenge from which consumers benefit.\n\nStandard equipment on the Cobra includes power brakes and steering (the car’s shortcoming is the absence of ABS, which will be offered for the ’95 model) and driver-side air bag (passenger-side comes with the ’95 model, too).\n\nThere also are very decorative metal Cobra snake emblems on the front fenders. Those emblems probably will last five minutes before the kids who steel Cadillac and Mercedes hood ornaments for necklaces get their hands on them.",

      "expert_review": "CLEVELAND — The 2007 Shelby GT Mustang will eventually end up in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nSome star will drive one in a video, rock from the roof during a concert or smash one into a wall, becoming the latest, greatest, superstar to burn out too soon.\n\nSo with that in mind, I took the new Shelby GT to the hall and scoped out where Ford might want to place the fastest piece of metal in the museum.\n\nA reincarnated pony car from Mustang’s glory days 40 years ago, this Shelby lives up to the nostalgic hype. Bringing Carroll Shelby back into the Ford fold fits better than Sammy Hagar ever did in Van Halen. (And the Shelby’s high-flow exhaust system sounds better too.)\n\nThe limited edition Shelby GT is part of Ford’s “gather no moss strategy”: Give the public fresh versions of the Mustang as often as possible. Like rock ‘n’ roll, the Mustang will never die. Today, Ford will announce plans to start building a convertible version of the Shelby GT.\n\nDon’t confuse this Mustang with the Shelby GT 500 or the Mustang GT — the Shelby GT fits between the two in Ford’s muscle car hierarchy. There’s also the plain ol’ Mustang and the Shelby GT 500 King of the Road, currently the ultimate ‘Stang.\n\nThis Mustang is born at Auto Alliance International Assembly Plant in Flat Rock as a GT and then shipped to Las Vegas for lessons at the Shelby finishing school — where it gets its power and distinctive branding, including Shelby’s name stretched across the back.\n\nBut Shelby doesn’t just add his name to these cars. He adds his LeMans-winning attitude, as well as the Ford Racing power upgrade package, which puts a few more ponies in the stable. The car’s 319-horsepower engine doesn’t start, it ignites, and then roars louder than The Who at Wembley Arena. It’s raw, it’s Megadeth (whose guitarist was Dave Mustaine — say his name out loud.).\n\nWild and powerful\n\nGrabbing the cue ball at the top of the Hurst short throw shifter, I muscle my test car into gear, drop the clutch and gun it. Yippie ki-ay\n\nBut the yippie fell flat once I crossed the border: “Welcome to Ohio: The land of cornfields and cops with hair-trigger radar guns.”\n\nThe Shelby GT wants to rock open highways. It feels wild and powerful, ready to bolt if you don’t hold the reins tightly.\n\nIts lowered body (about 1.5-inches lower than the Mustang GT) loves flat open roads — something Ohio has in spades.\n\nThe Shelby’s throaty engine taunts you to drop to fourth and let the 330-foot-pounds of torque give your passenger whiplash\n\nBut not near Toledo. Instead, I dutifully grab my toll ticket for Interstate 80 and see my first of many state troopers in the medium, no doubt on the radio.\n\n“Attention this is Buckeye Six,” I imagine the officer saying into a mic. “We’ve got another one, heading east, and it looks fast.”\n\nIt certainly does. The Shelby GT keeps all of the classic Mustang lines but adds an even more aggressive look. It’s more Sex Pistols than Rolling Stones. It’s the mean Mustang. The front-end snarls, with its low air dam and brushed-aluminum grille. Even the off-centered Mustang logo on the grille adds to its iconoclastic mindset.\n\nLike all Shelby GTs, my $40,000 test vehicle included the silver Le Mans stripes that stretch from the front of the hood to the rear spoiler. The two hood pins keep the giant piece of aluminum in place and add to its old school looks.\n\nThe riveted faux hood scoop is the only piece of the exterior that takes away from this Mustang’s lines. Decorative scoops are like pop music — needlessly taking up space. That said, the side scoops in front of the rear wheels add character and are reminiscent of the old GT 350 of the ’60s.\n\nPure Mustang looks\n\nThe ride inside the Shelby GT is rough. It’s loud, boisterous and certainly not the kind of car you’d use to take grandma to the hospital. My knee rested against the emergency brake handle while cruising, leaving a dull pain. But none of that bothered me. The total package outweighs the sum of minor inconveniences. Mystique and style overrule slight discomforts. It looks right and feels right.\n\nThe Shaker stereo blasts through the road and engine noise, playing just about any tune you’d want from the XM satellite radio, CDs or your choice of MP3 player. Volumes can reach obnoxiously loud levels as you bob your head in the extremely comfortable leather bucket seats. There’s a coarseness about the interior that seems to combine sophistication with function. Its simplicity makes it beautiful and the unique name plate with the car’s VIN and Carroll Shelby’s signature mounted on the dash erase the little interior gripes.\n\nThe back seats offer 30-inches of leg room, more than enough for an toy-sized Ace Freely action figure, but Kiss goodbye to fitting a full-sized Peter Criss back there, much less Gene Simmons or Paul Stanley.\n\nAnd the Shelby’s handling has the same raw kind of simple logic. The rack-and-pinion steering is very firm, but it feels right, both on the highway and in the city as the 18-inch wheels chew up the road.\n\nThe reverse L independent front suspension and three-link solid rear axle with coil springs make for a bouncy ride, especially when unexpected bumps arrive during a sharp turn as you’re hitting the gas. But the car calms itself quickly and it’s easy to maintain control.\n\nBut none of that takes away from this Mustang. Its unabashed blemishes are merely beauty marks on an amazing, fun machine that looks and feels the way it should.\n\nEveryone knows it’s a ‘Stang\n\nAbout 50 miles outside of Cleveland, my navigator looked at her hand scrawled directions and decided we weren’t where we were supposed to be.\n\nThe test vehicle didn’t have the optional navigation system so we simply took a left on some highway and drove until we found Lake Erie. The Hall of Fame was the big glass pyramid next to the Cleveland Browns Stadium, the home of the dog pound and a team with as many Super Bowl appearances Detroit’s Lions.\n\nThe crowd outside the museum heard us before we arrived, cocking their heads to see. As they watched the Shelby roll closer, even the car illiterate knew it was a special Mustang.\n\nThe place to park this baby, it turns out, is right out front, so everyone can see.\n\n2007 Ford Shelby GT\n\nType: Rear-wheel drive sports coupe Retail price: $36,970-$42.350 Models: One, but two colors, black or white Engine: 4.6-liter V-8 producing 319-horsepower, 330-pound-feet torque Transmission: 5-speed manual with Hurst shifter or 5-speed automatic EPA mileage: 16 mpg city / 23 mpg highway What makes it Shelby GT? All Mustangs are built in Flat Rock, but only 6,000 became 2007 Shelby GTs. It starts as a regular GT before heading to Las Vegas where Carroll Shelby’s team changes the car. The revised sports coupes include:\n\nA new front and rear fascia\n\nAn air scoop on the hood and side scoops on each side in front of the rear wheel well\n\nA Hurst short-throw shifter\n\nA high-flow exhaust system boosts power to 319 horses.\n\nSpecially tuned dampers and Ford’s race handling package\n\nSpecial branding: The name Shelby across the trunk and a nameplate on the dash with the car’s VIN and Carroll Shelby’s signature. Source: Ford Motor Co. Report card\n\nOverall: ****\n\nExterior: Excellent. Mean and powerful looking Mustang, special Shelby touches makes this car stand out.\n\nInterior: Good. Spartan feel adds to the car’s mystique, very comfortable for front passengers.\n\nSafety: Good. Front and side airbags and traction control.\n\nPerformance: Good. Powerful and fun on open roads.\n\nPros: Pure Mustang. Looks, feels and acts like the muscle cars from its heritage.\n\nCons: Not nimble on tight corners and interior feels bare bones.\n\nNotes: If you love Mustangs, you’ll love this car. Grading Scale: Excellent: **** Good: *** Fair: ** Poor: *\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News. He can be reached at (313) 223-3217 or sburgess@detnews.com.",

      "expert_review": "This is the last Pony standing in its field.\n\nWith the Camaro and Firebird going away, the Mustang, in several forms, remains the sole muscular Pony Car from the 1960’s.\n\nIt was a primitive, stiff, car then. It is, except in Cobra/SVT incarnations, a primitive, stiff car today.\n\nIt is muscular, its steering is not sharp, it still has a solid rear axle, and with its power and rear-wheel-drive configuration, it is prone to quick oversteer.\n\nYou got a problem with any of that?\n\nLots of folks don’t, because the Mustang endures as an American icon — if one getting a bit long in the tooth.\n\nThe 2002 Mustang GT convertible is a case in point.\n\nIt retains the essence of raw American power, has a muscular look, a powertrain that can outrun its platform, and too many interior instances of cutting corners on quality.\n\nThese days, when you pay more than $30,000 for a sports car/performance car, you should not have to put up with lots of hard plastic and other cheap interior appointments. The Germans in particular give us quality interiors at this price range: nicely paneled doors, textured dashboards, firm and supportive seats.\n\nThey even manage to give us at least some interior storage space in various bins and boxes that make great strategic use of the limited space of a smaller car.\n\nThis does not make the Mustang a bad car. It’s just that Ford is going to have to do better when it redesigns a car that has not been seriously tinkered with since 1999.\n\nThe GT convertible we tested came with a 4.6-liter, SOHC, V-8 engine that produces 260 horsepower and a solid 302 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nThat was plenty to move just over a ton-and-a-half of car. And it did it, aided by twin exhausts, to a truly appealing, burbling exhaust note.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic (as tested) are available in the GT. I found the automatic prone to somewhat sudden, jerky shifts when I got into the gas heavily.\n\nThe ride was stiff, with road feel imparted at every notch, nick, bump, or highway expansion joint. That’s not a totally bad thing, since the stiff ride helped keep the car .at when cornering in lane changes on the highway. However, on twisting back roads, where the G-forces climb and the pavement below is not as smooth and .at, the rear suspension tended to get twitchy, kicking out the rear even when not much power was being sent there.\n\nIt is an odd sensation in that you have a car powered like a well-trained thoroughbred, yet it can get skittish like a young colt.\n\nTraction control helped handle that skittishness. It uses a combination of torque sent to whichever rear wheel has the most grip and split-second application of the ABS system to help prevent skids and slides.\n\nThe GT has an independent strut syste m with separate lower-arm springs and a stabilizer bar up front and, in the rear, a four-bar link setup, coil springs, stabilizer bar, and, unfortunately, that solid horizontal axle. Hopefully the independent rear suspension found in the Cobra/SVT cars will trickle down into the lesser Mustangs in the next generation.\n\nThe powerplants from Ford just keep getting better. It is now a matter of tuning the architecture to support them.\n\nFrom the outside, the Mustang retains the long hood, short rear deck look reminiscent of the ’60s. Added this year, and further enhancing that ’60s appeal, are (nonfunctional) air scoops on the hood and behind each door.\n\nThe interior provides ample leg and headroom up front, while rear seat passengers will find their knees pinched against the front seats. Access to the rear seats is difficult and, even with the top down, allowing for contortions you could not perform in the coupe model, can be arduous The front seats are far too soft, nonsupportive, and even floppy at the back.\n\nThe twin cowl dash gives a tight cockpit feel for both passenger and driver. Gauges behind the wheel are stark and easy to read. Controls for climate and audio systems, at center dash, are made up of large, easy-to-find and use buttons and knobs.\n\nInterior storage space is virtually nonexistent (the biggest bin is in the console between seats) and the trunk space, already minimal, was largely devoured by the Mach 1000 audio system ($1,295) that came in the test model.\n\nThe views from the driver’s seat offer an interesting contrast.\n\nLooking out over the hood, a clean view is interrupted by the bulge of the air scoop.\n\nThat will give lots of folks a sense of power as they see this muscular protuberance bobbing ahead as, from the rear, they hear the basso burble of those twin exhausts (even though the one does nothing to contribute to the other).\n\nLooking out the rear is a different story.\n\nThe thick C-pillars of the upholstered convertible top cut angled vision considerably. Further, the small slit that is the rear window (at least it’s real glass) reveals a good view of the rear spoiler. Learn to use those outside mirrors, folks.\n\nThe Mustang seems to me to be a car at a crossroads. Still standing, but in need of some refinement. By that, I do not mean bleeding out its heart of hot American steel. Keep that heart beating. But to compete (and I’ve seen some of the upcoming GM platforms that could end up beneath hot new competitors) Ford has got to give the Mustang a better platform. Further, it needs to upgrade the quality of its interiors.\n\n2002 Ford Mustang GT convertible\n\nBase price: $28,390\n\nPrice as tested: $31,100\n\nHorsepower: 260\n\nTorque: 302 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 101.3 inches\n\nOverall length: 183.2 inches\n\nWidth: 73.1 inches\n\nHeight: 53.1 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,208 lbs.\n\nSeating: 4 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 20.3 miles per gallon\n\nSource: Ford Motor Co.; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nNice touch\n\nThe tight, easy-to-use, convertible top. Very quiet on the road. Easy to operate with two manual clamps and one automatic button.\n\nAnnoyance\n\nThe glove box. So small and thin it is difficult to store even a document inside without pinching it in the latch.",

      "expert_review": "Ford gets it right with the 2015 Mustang, thoroughly upgrading the historic muscle car inside and out while providing a welcome dose of the latest technology.\n\nFor 2015, Ford has completely redesigned its iconic pony car, an event that’s happened only a handful of times in the car’s 50-year history. This time, it’s produced a visually trimmer, meaner sports car with a new mission: take the Ford Mustang mystique to global markets.\n\nFord has sold the Mustang overseas before, but this new one — with its fully independent suspension, optional turbocharged four-cylinder engine and dramatically improved build quality — is made to challenge not only American competitors at home, but foreign coupes on foreign shores.\n\nThe 2015 model is a major redo compared with the outgoing 2014 (compare the two here), with new powertrains, a new interior, new technology and more. Yet a new Chevrolet Camaro is on the way and Dodge has just updated the 2015 Challenger. Is the new Mustang enough of an update to regain its status as king of the pony-car hill? I’ve driven two of the three powertrains available in the 2015 Mustang — the EcoBoost four-cylinder and the big V-8 (the V-6 has not yet been made available to sample) — and here’s how they stack up.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAt first glance, you’d be forgiven for thinking not much has changed from the old Mustang to the new one. The jury’s still out as to whether Ford went far enough in updating the car, but when spotted next to an outgoing model on the highway the subtle differences and styling improvements become obvious. The ’15 also adds many design themes from non-muscle-car Fords, like the hexagonal grille and lidded headlights, butched up for muscle-car duty.\n\nComparisons are still being made, however, with the Ford Taurus and Fusion sedans, and it’s certainly possible to see those cars’ influence. The Mustang’s best angle may be the rear three-quarters, where the svelte and sloped tri-bar LED taillights look absolutely fantastic and the muscular wheel arches become much more prominent. The roofline and window openings are also subtly different from the 2014 model. The overall look is conservative, but nobody will mistake it for anything other than a Mustang.\n\nHow It Drives\nI’ve driven the Ford Mustang on several occasions, first on canyon roads around Los Angeles and most recently at a private racetrack in rural Illinois. Along with the carryover V-6 and V-8 engines — both with revised power output — comes a new entry: a turbocharged, 2.3-liter four-cylinder direct-injected EcoBoost engine that’s also found (in slightly less-powerful form) under the hood of the Lincoln MKC crossover. In the Mustang, it makes 310 horsepower and 320 pounds-feet of torque — extremely impressive lb-ft numbers for a four-cylinder engine.\n\nConsider: This is more horsepower than the 1996 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra’s 4.6-liter V-8 pumped out, and it’s said to get 32 mpg on the highway. That’s serious progress, folks. Even though the Mustang EcoBoost I drove came with a six-speed automatic transmission, it was highly enjoyable. Punch the push-button start, now standard in all Mustangs, and the turbo four growls to life with a surprisingly throaty rasp. You’ll never mistake it for the V-8 in the GT, but it has a certain aural charm all its own. It should be noted, however, that all the sound you hear isn’t coming from the engine — it’s supplemented by a prerecorded soundtrack that’s piped through the speakers. Ford does this because the turbocharged engine is simply too quiet for the Mustang; all the sound insulation and the turbocharger itself act to quiet the exhaust noise to the point that it simply doesn’t sound like a proper sports car. The piped-in music fixes that, and if you didn’t know it wasn’t live, you wouldn’t be able to tell. Just turn it on, snick the automatic transmission into Drive, give it gas and prepare to be surprised — this thing is quick.\n\nVarious publications have pegged the Mustang EcoBoost’s zero-to-60 mph time in the mid-5-second range — not too shabby for a car this heavy. In fairness, I should point out that all the cars in this class are heavy, and of the trio of Camaro, Challenger and Mustang, the Ford is the lightest. The automatic transmission kicks down noticeably when you give it some gas, but in around-town driving it’s extremely flexible, with a broad torque curve. Get out into the canyons and flip the toggle switch to engage Sport mode, though, and the Mustang EcoBoost comes alive. (It’s one of four standard selectable drive modes.)\n\nThe systems that Sport mode affects, such as steering effort and transmission shift aggressiveness, can also be independently adjusted. In Sport, steering feel firms up noticeably, throttle response gets more rapid and the transmission becomes amazingly precise. In short, it becomes remarkably fun to drive. Oddly, the same cannot be said on the track. The EcoBoost Mustang some of my colleagues drove there did not exhibit the same kind of spirit as the one I drove on twisty streets, leading us to wonder whether the EcoBoost is simply better-suited to real-world driving than track work — at least with the automatic transmission.\n\nThe suspension — now all independent, front and rear — keeps the Ford Mustang solidly planted. With the EcoBoost’s optional 18-inch alloy wheels, ride quality is superb, but it’s less so when the sport suspension and the GT’s optional 19-inch alloy wheels come into play. The tuning should impress even European drivers who have long considered American cars to be rubbish. Unlike four-cylinder Mustangs of the past, buyers can check the option for the 2015 EcoBoost and not regret their decision in the slightest.\n\nOf course, the GT — with its 435-hp V-8 — is more of everything. More noise, more thrust, more ability — but also more weight and more money. It doesn’t feel quite as agile as the EcoBoost, but what it lacks in fancy moves it makes up for in brute force and V-8 audio bliss. The Getrag six-speed manual transmission has clean, easy shifts, but the clutch is fairly heavy; driving it through stop-and-go Los Angeles traffic has to be one of Dante’s circles of hell.\n\nThe GT also brings bigger brakes that are firmer but less easy to modulate than those on the standard EcoBoost; they’re great for bleeding off speed before turning into a corner, but not as great when you’re just trying to negotiate rush hour. For some people, the V-8 is essential to the pony-car experience, and I understand that thinking — it’s visceral and exciting and something of a tradition. But for the first time, a lesser motor in the Mustang may be just as entertaining, thanks to a far more balanced overall package.\n\nThat said, on the track the V-8 GT is just crazy amounts of fun. Instant torque-on-demand means you can steer with either the wheel in your hands or the pedal under your right foot, your choice. The two powertrains I tested create Mustangs with two very different personalities. If you intend to drive yours on a track often, the V-8 GT might be a better choice, but if you simply want an agile sports car that can make your commute through the back roads more entertaining, the EcoBoost version is the one to choose.\n\nFuel economy varies for each powertrain depending on which transmission you opt for — the base V-6 with a manual transmission is rated 17/28/21 mpg city/highway/combined, climbing to 19/28/22 mpg with the automatic. The EcoBoost four-cylinder is more powerful than the V-6 yet is rated higher: 22/31/26 mpg with the stick-shift, 21/32/25 mpg with the automatic. Of course, the big V-8 isn’t quite so frugal, rated 15/25/19 mpg with the manual, 16/25/19 with the automatic. That’s about dead even with comparable V-8-equipped Camaros and Challengers. Comparing the turbocharged four-cylinder Mustang with the V-6 Camaro and Challenger, however, gives the advantage to the Mustang, which is why everyone expects to see a four-cylinder Camaro in the not-too-distant future.\n\nInterior\nFord has done considerable work on the Mustang’s interior, and one absent feature should send cheers throughout the automotive world: There isn’t a single touch-sensitive control panel anywhere, aside from the central LCD touch-screen. Quite the opposite, in fact: Ford has introduced toggle switches along the base of the center console for hazard lights, stability control, steering effort adjustment and the Drive Select mode function.\n\nThe all-new Ford Mustang’s interior combines the best of two competitors — the neat retro styling touches of the Camaro with the roomier environment of the Dodge Challenger. Like that car, the Mustang has the width and headroom to keep bigger drivers happy, with decent forward visibility thanks to a long, sculpted hood stretching out before you. More surprising is how good visibility is over your shoulder: the long side windows have been extended since the outgoing model, eliminating the little quarter windows and noticeably improving visibility to the rear and sides.\n\nThe base model’s seats are supportive and comfortable, with Recaro leather seats an option for performance-minded buyers. But the Recaros have some issues: They’re not comfortable, largely due to their limited adjustability, they’re not power-operated, and their wide shoulder supports make a new lever in the Ford Mustang — located in the top middle of the front seatback and used to fold it forward for entry into the rear seats — completely unusable. You simply can’t reach it from outside the car, making me wonder if anyone even tested this feature before production started. You’d be better off sticking with the power-adjustable, non-sport seats. Of course, access to the backseat isn’t terribly important, anyway, as it remains too tiny for adult use. It might work for pre-teen children.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nFord’s Sync system is standard, but MyFord Touch is optional only on higher trims. That system brings a big touch-screen to the center console, within easy reach of driver and passenger. It’s familiar fare from Ford and works quite well — even the voice commands that used to be a problem. A standard “Track Apps” suite of programs allows the driver to adjust engine, steering and transmission tuning between Normal, Sport, Eco and Track modes, while a “line-lock” launch-control feature also comes standard, enabling drag-strip style starts by braking the front wheels and letting the rear tires spin and heat up. Track Apps is similar to the Performance Pages app found in Dodge’s new Challengers and Chargers, and it’s both fun and useful.\n\nCargo & Storage\nStorage has been improved in the new Ford Mustang, both up front and in the trunk. More thought has gone into it, too. The front cupholders have been relocated closer to the passenger and pushed farther back to minimize stick-shift interference. The door pockets are deeper, as is the glove compartment, which now has a knee airbag built right into the glove box door. The trunk is larger, with a bigger and lower opening that now enables it to accommodate two sets of golf clubs. It’s not as big as the Challenger’s massive trunk, but it’s more commodious than the Camaro’s single-duffel-bag capacity. The Mustang brings 13.5 cubic feet of trunk space, versus just 11.3 cubic feet in the Camaro. The Challenger, which is essentially a short-wheelbase, two-door Charger sedan, beats everyone with a voluminous 16.2 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe Mustang’s redesign also brought a change in its electrical systems, which has enabled Ford to add available advanced features like blind-spot warning, forward collision alert and adaptive cruise control, plus standard additional airbags, including the aforementioned passenger knee airbag that’s mounted in the glove box door. The Mustang was too new to have been crash-tested as of publication. See all the Mustang’s standard and optional safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Ford Mustang spans a wide range of prices, starting at $24,425 (including destination) for a V-6-powered fastback with a manual transmission. A convertible model is also available, with the least expensive version just edging under 30 grand, at $29,925. The cheapest EcoBoost-equipped four-cylinder Mustang comes in at $25,995, but to get that engine in a convertible you have to shell out for the EcoBoost Premium trim, which starts at $35,495. The V-8 comes in the GT, starting at $32,925. The most expensive Mustang is a loaded GT Premium convertible with a special 50th Anniversary appearance package that costs more than $50,000.\n\nThe performance deal of the decade may just be the EcoBoost coupe with a $1,995 Performance Package that adds bigger brakes, 19-inch wheels, a gauge pack for the interior, a 3.55 limited-slip rear axle, a larger radiator and the sport suspension. For around the same price as a loaded Scion FR-S or Honda Accord coupe, you’ll get a car that can run rings around either of them at any track day, and is far more comfortable and spacious to boot.\n\nThe Ford Mustang’s competitors are just as legendary as the Ford. This generation of the Chevrolet Camaro is on its last year — due for replacement for the 2016 model year — but constant upgrades to packages and performance trims have made it the better-selling car for a while now. It’s not nearly as comfortable or nice inside as the new Mustang, and visibility out of it is atrocious. But in ZL1 guise it’s a performance monster — and has some of the only comfortable Recaro seats in existence.\n\nThe Dodge Challenger just got a makeover for 2015, too, and it’s considerably improved from its previous incarnation. Easily as nice inside as the new Ford Mustang, it’s even bigger inside and out (you can fit three child-safety seats in the back of a Challenger), has more powerful engines (Hellcat!), plenty of retro style, and comparably good fuel economy in V-6 trim. What it does not have is a convertible model, much to many sun enthusiasts’ dismay. Less-conventional competitors might be the aforementioned Subaru BRZ or Hyundai Genesis coupe, or even the front-wheel-drive Honda Accord coupe. They’re all similar in price but not in performance, making the Mustang a better value than any of the other similar cars. Compare the Ford Mustang to its competition here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2008 Ford Shelby GT500 King of the Road scares me.\n\nIt’s a Mustang with a sticker price of $79,995. Ford only made 1,000 of them in 2008 and dealers have asked much more than the suggested retail price.\n\nBut my fear did not stem from the car’s price. I’ve driven more expensive vehicles and less practical ones.\n\nReally, the GT500KR didn’t frighten me when I got inside it and fired up that 5.4-liter supercharged V-8. I may not have fully respected this Mustang when I hopped into it for the first time, but I sure as heck did by the time I got out of it.\n\nThe first “incident” occurred along Gibraltar Road when I started to pass a minivan poking its way up the same straightaway.\n\nWith no oncoming traffic and the lane open, I dropped the six-speed manual into third and kicked out to the left. The moment I mashed the pedal to the floor and listened to that supercharged whirl come from under the hood, the SVT light on the speedometer lit up and the back end of the KR jumped to the left and shuddered — full power, full torque ripping through the rear axle.\n\n“Oh, sassafras” — that’s paraphrased — blurted out of my mouth.\n\nThe car leaped forward. I passed the minivan almost instantaneously, and the car still charged harder.\n\nI was a rodeo cowboy. I was Slim Pickens on an H-bomb barreling to automotive glory. Don’t let that laugh hide my terror.\n\nFive-hundred and forty horses under the hood will do that sort of thing and the monster of all Mustangs earns its title as King of the Road at every stop light and on every highway.\n\nA friend at Ford Motor Co. had told me to make sure the specially designed Goodyear F1 tires warmed up before I pushed this car — but no one should ever tell a reporter life-saving advice when handing him keys. We can’t think when there’s something so shiny in front of us.\n\nThe tires are just one of the many pieces of specially tuned parts of the King Mustang, the last of the special edition Mustangs in this generation pony car. But don’t worry, Ford promises to continue its relationship with Shelby when the redesigned 2010 pony appears next year.\n\nStarting with the underpinnings of the Shelby GT500, the King of the Road adds a carbon fiber hood, new front splitter, rear spoiler, a unique suspension, special tuning and a number of Ford Racing upgrades to boost the supercharged engine’s performance. (Ford added a cold air intake, and tweaked the ignition and throttle calibrations.)\n\nThis is a Mustang that takes its name from the original King of the Road (built in 1968) but blows its namesake away.\n\nThere are still some retro throwbacks. The hood fastens down with two steel pins on the edge. (Ford says it does this to handle all of the pressure generated by the supercharger.) I don’t care. It just looks cool. The hood vents also help suck in enough air to power this behemoth of a V-8.\n\nAnd man, does that engine howl.\n\nBig muscle cars need a certain engine note — and the KR hums along nicely until you unleash it and it transforms from James Taylor to Axl Rose. Acceleration is quick and once you get above 3,000 rpm, the car’s power truly kicks in. The Tremec TR6060 six-speed manual transmission connected to Ford Racing’s new short throw shifter cuts shifting distance by 25 percent. The throws feel clean and quick.\n\nAnd if the tires are properly warmed, this car does more than just burn super fast straight lines. It actually can take a corner without the backend hopping on that solid rear axle.\n\nThe steering calibration did not offer as much feedback as I would have liked on the highway but around town it seemed better weighted. However, this may have been a result of me holding the wheel so tightly.\n\nIncident No. 2: Highway entrance ramps. Anyone who likes to go fast knows that one of the best places to test a vehicle is on an entrance ramp. There’s a feeling that there’s a free pass for perhaps going over the speed limit. So, we floor it.\n\nOn one around Detroit, I took the KR and drilled it as I came around a 90 degree corner, expecting to power slide through the turn. Hey, it happens in these cars. Much to my surprise, the KR stuck to the road and I shot out of the corner like a stone from David’s sling.\n\nFortunately, there was no one immediately in front of me, as I would have put a Le Mans stripe into their trunk.\n\nInside the King of the Road, the driver feels like royalty. The leather interior features embroidered headrests and a 40th-anniversary dash plate at the top of the center stack. Ford has added a few luxury items as well such as ambient lighting (with seven color choices), HID headlamps and an optional Shaker 1000 stereo and navigation system.\n\nBut the King is not about luxury. It’s about power — and this is absolutely the most powerful Mustang in the family. It’s the kind of power you have to respect, and if you don’t, it’ll teach you quickly why you should in tire spinning, body shaking fashion.\n\nPersonally, I would add Sync, the hands-free phone and music device player, to the car’s system, just to request Tom Petty’s “Good to be King.” I’d play that every day on the way to work.\n\nIt might help calm my nerves.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "If you think the newest generation of the Ford Mustang coupe is great, you’ve gotta love the convertible.\n\nTwo models are offered – the V-6, with a base price of $24,660, and the V-8 powered GT, starting at $30,685 (both prices include freight).\n\nGranted, the convertibles are a bit pricier than the coupes, which start under $20,000. But for those who can afford the extra dough, the ragtops are well worth the money. The most expensive version is the GT Premium model, which we tested.\n\nIt comes with a base price of $31,840. With a few extras tacked on, our 2006 model’s list price totaled $35,415, which arguably is a lot to pay for a Mustang.\n\nCertainly there are luxury cars you can buy for that kind of money, but the Mustang still comes across as a good value because of its originality.\n\nThe fact is that there’s just nothing else like it, and if you’re a longtime Mustang fan, as many of us baby boomers are, then the price is not really an issue. They say that many of us have extra disposable income these days, what with the kids gone and their college paid for.\n\nFord rolled out the newest Mustang in coupe form first, in August 2004 as an ’05 model. Then in spring 2005, the convertible was added to the lineup.\n\nI’m glad the automaker chose to include a V-6 model in the ragtop version so that those of us who don’t feel the need for V-8 power can have an affordable alternative. Most of the new Mustangs, and the convertibles in particular, have sold faster than Ford can build them.\n\nThat’s due in large part to their retro styling, which revived the look of the revered mid-1960s Mustangs, specifically the 1967 fastback model.\n\nFord reported sales of 160,975 Mustangs during calendar year 2005, with only about 30 percent of those being V-8 models.\n\nMost of the retro styling of the coupes has carried over to the convertibles, including the long hood and three-section taillights.\n\nBut the ragtop versions are missing the sloping rear window that created the famous fastback look. That had to give way to the retractable soft top.\n\nEven so, the convertible is stunning in its own right, and brings lots of looks wherever it goes.\n\nMy first drive of one was last year in Southern California, and as I drove it along the Pacific Coast Highway, the most-obvious admirers were those driving older Mustangs. And for those who have been longtime Mustang fans, the new ragtop usually inspires a case of love at first sight.\n\nThat reaction isn’t limited to those folks, however. The new model appeals to a broad range of people from youth to aging baby boomers, male and female alike, one of the few cars on the market that can transcend age and gender barriers.\n\nAs I’ve noted before, nearly everyone has a Mustang story in his or her life – even those who have never owned one.\n\nThe cars are revered by many baby boomers who came of age during the mid- to late-1960s, just after the Mustang’s 1964 introduction.\n\nFord has long been credited with a stroke of genius for the creation of the Mustang, and that’s certainly true again with this retro-styled new generation.\n\nThe big draw of these new models is their retro styling combined with modern drivetrains, suspensions and safety equipment.\n\nConvertibles have made up about a fourth of all Mustang sales in the past, with women the primary buyers and V-6 models the most popular versions. But Ford said the newest Mustang ragtop is designed to have broader appeal, especially among enthusiasts who like the GT versions with their V-8s.\n\nOne drawback of the earlier models was the body shake and shimmy that is often associated with convertibles, thanks to the loss of structural support with the removal of the top.\n\nBut Ford has worked miracles with the new Mustang convertible – the body seems nearly as rigid as that of the coupe.\n\nWhile driving the vehicle along some punishing roads, the new convertible showed virtually no signs of shimmying or shaking, even on some rather large bumps.\n\nFord says it took great pains to keep the convertible’s chassis rigid to eliminate body flex that most convertible fans have come to expect as an annoying but unfortunately necessary part of the ragtop driving experience.\n\nHandling is superb, especially with the GT, which comes with 17-inch, W-rated performance tires. Optional are 18-inch wheels and tires, which came on ours.\n\nThe new convertible’s interior is clean and uncluttered, with a dash that also is a throwback to the ’60s.\n\nThe premium model we tested came with red leather sport-bucket seats, which were quite comfortable even during sharp cornering.\n\nThe power-operated top can be opened in about 20 seconds after releasing the two catches on the top of the windshield and pushing a button on the overhead console above the rearview mirror.\n\nThe top has a glass rear window for great rearward visibility; it even includes a rear defroster.\n\nInsulated fabric in the top keeps the interior very quiet for a convertible when it is up. When it is down, even at highway speeds wind intrusion into the cockpit is kept to a minimum, thanks to the steeply-raked windshield and the design of the rear seatbacks, Ford says.\n\nThere is little wind noise in the cockpit at highway speeds with the top down, which is remarkable for a ragtop.\n\nRear quarter windows can be opened or closed by a power switch on the driver’s side, but they cannot be open or closed separately – it’s both up or both down.\n\nUnder the hood of the V-6 model is the same 4.0-liter engine used in the coupe, rated at 210 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nI have driven the V-6 version, and found it perfectly adequate for my tastes, particularly with its slightly better EPA fuel-economy ratings (19 miles per gallon city/28 highway with the manual gearbox; 19 city/25 highway with automatic).\n\nBut for performance addicts, the GT is the only choice. The convertible comes with the same 4.6-liter V-8 in the GT coupe, rated at 300 horsepower and 320 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nSurprisingly, the highway fuel-economy rating for the GT with the five-speed manual gearbox is 25 mpg, the same as the V-6 with automatic. City mileage is 17 mpg, and for the GT automatic, highway mileage drops to 23 mpg.\n\nStandard features of the V-6 convertibles include a five-speed manual transmission, 16-inch painted cast-aluminum wheels with all-season tires, air conditioning, dual power mirrors, AM/FM stereo with single CD player, four-wheel power disc brakes, power door locks with remote keyless entry, and power windows with driver and passenger door one-touch up/down.\n\nThe V-6 Premium model begins at $25,635, and comes with such extras as 16-inch bright aluminum wheels with chrome spinner, Shaker 500 audio system with six-disc CD changer and MP3 capability, and a six-way power adjustable driver’s seat.\n\nOptions include an exterior sport appearance package ($295), interior upgrade package ($450), five-speed automatic transmission ($995), antilock brakes with all-speed traction control ($775), side air bags ($370), leather seating surfaces ($695), an active anti-theft system ($255) and a convertible soft boot for $195.\n\nGT models come with a five-speed manual transmission, four-wheel antilock power disc brakes with all-speed traction control, sport-tuned stainless steel dual exhaust, front fog lights built into the grille, a rear spoiler and a tilt steering wheel, 17-inch painted aluminum wheels with performance tires, air conditioning, dual power mirrors, AM/FM stereo with single CD player, power door locks with remote keyless entry, and power windows with driver and passenger one-touch up/down.\n\nThe GT Premium model includes the Shaker 500 audio system with CD changer and MP3 capability, as well as the leather bucket seats. But our test car came with an even-better stereo – the Shaker 1000 system, a $1,295 option.\n\nOther options on our car included an interior upgrade package ($450), interior color accent package ($175), front-seat side air bags ($370), the 18-inch bright-machined painted aluminum wheels ($825), active anti-theft system ($295), Shaker 1000 audio system ($1,295) and a convertible boot cover ($115).\n\nOurs came with the manual gearbox, but a five-speed automatic is offered for $995 on the GT model as well.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "‘Twas the first night of summer when my cellphone rang.\n\nIt was Mrs. G.\n\nHer message was succinct. “I’m not sure what that car is, but you’re putting the top down and taking me for a ride tonight,” she said.\n\n“Tonight” turned out to be a string of nights in a week’s worth of joyriding with the accent on “joy.” There’s nothing quite like a convertible when the weather gods send a week of early-summer weather your way. And it’s even more enjoyable when said convertible is a certified “head-turner.”\n\n“That car” turned out to be a 2011 Mustang GT convertible. It’s powered by Ford’s new 5.0-liter Ti-VCT V-8 and a new six-speed automatic transmission. The Ti-VCT stands for “twin independent variable camshaft timing” which manipulates the four-valves-per-cylinder timing to increase peak power by up to seven percent, low-rpm torque by up to five percent, and fuel economy by 4.5 percent.\n\nI’d had the privilege to drive the V-6 version last month in New York and was impressed both with that car and its “first car to have 300 horsepower (actually 305) and achieve 30 miles per gallon” status. The combination put me in the camp of those who feel the V-8’s days are numbered.\n\nWell, if that’s the case, let it be on the record that this V-8, which puts out 412 horsepower and 390 lb.-ft. of torque, is a tiger when you want it to be but a pussycat when you’re putting around town with a wonderful exhaust note burbling behind you. It also tells you the V-8 isn’t going away quite yet, though you pay a premium for one.\n\nOur test car has a base price of $38,695 (including destination) and a final price of $41,860. Major additions were the automatic transmission ($995), 19-inch wheels, rearview camera, and a security system.\n\nStand on the gas and you believe Ford’s claim of 0 to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds. Equally, if not more impressive, is the passing performance. It jumped from 40 to 65 in a heartbeat while passing a clot of slow-moving cars on I-95.\n\nCredit the six-speed automatic’s gearing for producing breathtaking launches at the low end and having a tall sixth gear for highway economy on the other end. There’s so much power that Ford is able to use a 3:15 (economy ratio) rear axle. The transmission also has a grade-assist or “hill mode” to provide engine braking on descents and longer time in lower gears on climbs. Alas, one thing lacking in the new tranny is a manual mode with a shift gate or paddle shifters.\n\nFord has done a nice job with body stiffness, handling, and suspension tuning. We hit a series of diagonal expansion grates on highway bridges that produced a touch of body twist, but overall the Mustang was a marvelous mix of decent handling, nice cornering, and smoothness. “Make sure you say it was comfortable on the bumpy roads,” says Mrs. G. The Ford guys say that comfort is the result of such items as the standard tower-to-tower front strut brace, and added Z-brace, stronger crossmembers and stiffer A pillars.\n\nWe’re coming to understand that suspension engineers are underrated when they add elements such as stronger lower control arms and firmer stabilizer bar bushings, then adjust spring rates and damper tuning to get an improved combination of handling, cornering, and ride. The driving dynamics are only enhanced by the move away from hydraulic power steering to an EPAS (electric power steering assist) system.\n\nFord credits the EPAS system for helping design a quieter vehicle. It combines with some newer technologies to enhance the driving experience. “Drift-Pull Compensation” adjusts for crosswinds and minor road crowning, and “Active Nibble Control” helps eliminate shimmy at higher speeds if a wheel is out of balance or a brake rotor is warped.\n\nThe GT had an overall redesign for the 2010 model. The 2011 version continues those cues with new headlamps, lower fascias, a power dome hood that adds a muscle-flexing appearance while aiding engine cooling and allowing designers to hide the windshield washer nozzles.\n\nA welcome touch on the Mustang is a pair of integrated blind-spot mirror inserts, something that will be standard on new Fords that don’t have electric blind spot warning systems. Also welcome is the windshield design that keeps wind-buffeting to a minimum at highway speeds with the top down. And lest we forget, raising or lowering the top involves two easy to manipulate latches and one button.\n\nThe rear design features a massive GT badge and sequential three-bulb taillights in a decidedly ’60s-era look. A rearview camera lens is tucked neatly into the rear spoiler on vehicles equipped with that option.\n\nThe interior is nicely appointed and quite nice for a muscle car, though clearly not at luxury level. We appreciated the comfort of the leather seats with color inserts matching the exterior color. The speedometer and tachometer are retro-styled, reminding me of Ford speedometers from the ’50s and ’60s; except this one tops out at 160 mph and the tach goes to the 7,000 rpm redline.\n\nIt’s hard to believe the Mustang turned 45 years old last year. Clearly, it’s going as strong as ever.",

      "expert_review": "We haven’t reviewed the Mustang since its 2005 redesign, so it was high time to see how this pony car has aged, especially since it will be redesigned again next year. After spending a few hundred miles behind the wheel of a 2009 Mustang GT coupe, some things still impress, but there’s clearly room for improvement in other areas.\n\nWhen the Mustang was redesigned for 2005, it created a sensation in the car world. It was easy to see the car’s modern interpretation of classic Mustang design cues on the outside and inside; it took what was great about older Mustangs and brought those elements into the 21st century. Since then, Ford has had free reign in the muscle car realm, but Dodge and Chevrolet are returning to this once hotly contested segment with a modern-day Challenger and Camaro. Ford is set to answer with an updated Mustang for 2010, but few details are available as of this writing.\n\nI haven’t driven the new Camaro, which isn’t on sale yet, but I have tested the new Challenger, and I’d still take a Mustang over it because of the Ford’s more engaging driving experience.\n\nStyling\nPeople have strong allegiances when it comes to muscle cars, and on the whole I like the Mustang’s exterior design — especially when you consider the version it replaced. The current model’s larger dimensions work really well with the retro styling cues and give the coupe better proportions overall. (See a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model.)\n\nSo what are those retro cues, you ask? Practically anywhere you look on the exterior, you’ll see one. In front, it’s the forward-swept grille and round headlights. On the side, it’s subtle sheet-metal creases behind the doors and the fastback roofline, both of which are reminiscent of Mustangs from the late ’60s. In back, it’s large red taillights that recall those from early Mustangs.\n\nA variety of aluminum wheels are available for the Mustang, some of which have a retro appearance, complete with fake spinners. The standard wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, but 17- and 18-inch rims are also offered.\n\nRide & Handling\nWhat impressed me more in the Mustang than in the Challenger was handling prowess. Both cars offer relatively comfortable ride quality for performance cars, but the Mustang’s weighty steering feel is worlds better than the Challenger’s light steering.\n\nHelping the Mustang’s cause is the fact that it’s smaller than the Challenger — and it feels that way from the driver’s seat. While the Challenger feels huge when you look out over its big hood, that sensation isn’t there in the Mustang.\n\nEven though the Challenger is quite large, it handles corners surprisingly well, as does the Mustang GT; body roll in the Mustang is well-controlled, and the chassis feels very planted and stable.\n\nThe Mustang’s biggest downside in terms of ride and handling is its solid rear axle, a design that’s long past its prime for a sports car. You would think that if the Ford Expedition full-size SUV gets an independent rear suspension then the Mustang would too, but that’s not the case. My problem with this design is its tendency to, when the car hits a bump or hole in the road, distribute the impact of one rear wheel to the other one, thereby unsettling both wheels rather than just one. Here’s hoping the updated 2010 Mustang gets an independent rear suspension.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nBy definition, a muscle car needs to have some actual muscle under its hood. In the Mustang, that muscle comes in the form of an optional V-8 engine (a V-6 is standard). The all-aluminum 4.6-liter V-8 makes 300 horsepower. That may sound like a lot of power, but it falls well short of the power specs for the V-8s in the Challenger R/T (376 hp with the manual transmission) and upcoming Camaro SS (422 hp with the manual). Both the Challenger R/T and Camaro SS, however, are significantly heavier than the current Mustang. I wouldn’t be surprised if Ford answered with a more powerful V-8 for the 2010 Mustang.\n\nBut back to the car at hand. The 2009 Mustang GT’s V-8 offers strong, if not overwhelming, acceleration, accompanied by a sonorous exhaust note through the dual exhaust system. The exhaust rumble is still there when cruising on the highway, but it’s much more muted. At any rate, it’s sure to be a glorious symphony to muscle car fans’ ears.\n\nLike the V-6, the V-8 is available with a five-speed manual or a five-speed automatic transmission. My test car had the five-speed manual, and it features a short-throw shifter that moves from gear to gear with a mechanical feel; it takes some effort to push the shifter around, but this does more to enhance the beefy feel of the car than to make it feel unrefined. The clutch pedal, on the other hand, is light and doesn’t take much effort to depress; even after constantly working the clutch pedal when commuting in rush-hour traffic, my leg never tired.\n\nThe Mustang’s brake pedal feels much more solid underfoot, which is good for your confidence if you have to hit the brakes hard. The Mustang’s nose dives a little during hard braking (just like it rises a little when you hit the gas from a stop), but braking response is very controllable and progressive.\n\nThe Inside\nLike the outside of the Mustang, the cabin has a number of retro cues, including a stepped dashboard and thin-spoke steering wheel. The script for the gauges and the appearance of the optional leather seats in my GT test car also fit into the retro theme. Some areas of the car, like the center control panel, have a generically modern look, but the buttons and switches move with a fair degree of refinement.\n\nThe GT’s front bucket seats offer good comfort on longer drives; I took a three-hour trip in the Mustang and stepped out without feeling sore at all thanks to the seat’s soft cushioning.\n\nFord has made a push to offer unique cabin lighting in its cars, and the Mustang is included in that effort. The available MyColor feature consists of adjustable backlighting for the gauges and front cupholders, which means you can change the gauges from white to orange, for instance.\n\nThe Mustang is also available with a glass roof, which is a new option for 2009. For $1,995, Ford replaces the coupe’s metal roof with a large, fixed piece of glass that makes the Mustang’s cabin feel extremely open. You can dim external light sources somewhat with a sliding sunshade, but you can’t completely block them out because the shade is made of a mesh fabric.\n\nCargo\nEven though the Mustang is a two-door sports car, it offers a usable trunk that measures 13.1 cubic feet (9.7 cubic feet in the convertible). Coupes have a 50/50-split folding backseat that makes it easier to carry long items inside the car.\n\nSafety\nThe Mustang has standard side-impact airbags for the front seats, but a number of other important safety features are either optional or not offered: Antilock brakes and traction control are optional, and side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system aren’t offered. Most Challenger trims have a stability system, while the Camaro will offer it as standard equipment across the line.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Mustang convertible Good overall (the highest score possible) in its side-impact crash test and Acceptable overall in the frontal-offset test.\n\nMustang in the Market\nThe big unknown in the muscle car world is the new Camaro, which looks like a promising entry on paper but hadn’t been tested as of publication. If you’re a Camaro fan, waiting a few more months for your car is probably preferable to getting a Mustang now. Similarly, Dodge fans aren’t likely to walk into a Ford or Chevy showroom to see the competition. Like I said, allegiances run deep.\n\nWhat all of this renewed action in the muscle-car segment seems most likely to do is bring enthusiasts who left when their favorite model was dropped back to the segment, as well as some new fans, too. The state of the nation’s economy and continued concern over gas prices are sure to put a damper on sales of these “fun” cars, but even though Dodge and Chevy have newer offerings, the current Mustang is still a solid muscle car. It’ll be interesting to see how the new one compares.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "I figured the 2010 Ford Mustang would be a fun car to drive, but this muscle car exceeded my expectations. With its redesign, the Mustang looks more modern than its predecessor, and I appreciated all of the fun details packed into the hefty sports coupe.\n\nWhat makes a muscle car is its engine, and the Mustang didn’t disappoint. My test car, a GT Premium, had a V-8 engine and cost $34,420; a base Mustang with a V-6 engine starts at a much lower $21,395 MSRP.\n\nThe V-8 engine provided the perfect amount of rumble as my kids and I rolled through our neighborhood, letting everyone know when we were home or getting close. The Mustang felt solid and sporty, which means it cornered with a little tilting and tons of ready-to-go power. To back up all those full-throttle horsies, braking in the Mustang was quick and strong.\n\nThe only thing that stopped me from hitting the road with complete confidence was the driver’s seat position. While I found the seat to be supportive and comfy, I had a hard time adjusting it to fit my driving needs. The challenges were twofold: The steering wheel could tilt but didn’t telescope, so I couldn’t bring it closer to me, and the head restraints pushed my head forward so much that it felt awkward. Basically, I looked like a zombie with my arms outstretched and my head tilted slightly downward. Not hot!\n\nBy the end of my test week, I had adjusted the seat several times and did get more comfortable as time progressed, but I never found a perfect position.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Mustang’s redesign stands out with its strong lines and wicked styling. Large fog lights placed within the black grille draw the eye inward. From the side, three different sheet metal contours met directly below the tiny peek a boo second-row window.\n\nBeneath the sheet metal sat a 315-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 engine with a five-speed manual transmission. The Mustang takes regular gas and gets an EPA-estimated 16/24 mpg city/highway.\n\nReally, the Mustang was a convenient size for trips with my boys. We were able to climb in easily, and the doors weren’t too heavy or cumbersome. The lack of backseat legroom won’t make most adults happy, but my kids fit fine back there. I liked that they were close to me if I needed to hand them something.\n\nThe trunk wasn’t huge, but it held my groceries just fine. Bulky strollers and other baby gear may pose a tougher challenge, though.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nINTERIOR\nFrom the sporty aluminum gearshift knob to the fiery red ambient lighting in the cupholders and door bins, the Mustang dazzled me. The stylish interior included Brick Led leather upholstery with a white stripe running down each seat and small Mustang logos that added shimmer to the interior door panels.\n\nThe stereo controls were easy to reach and use, with no waffling over buttons to find a radio station. I had a hard time getting the fan to operate how I wanted, though. At first it wasn’t blowing hard enough, but then I realized I had selected the wrong mode, a pretty easy mistake due to the non-descript button for fan settings.\n\nThe visibility was good from every angle. There were no bulky accessories or pillars to block my view, and the rear window was big enough to get a good look through via the rearview mirror.\n\nThe backseat, which seats two, had no frills. There weren’t any cupholders or window buttons for the kids to them. As a parent, this was nice since fewer distractions result in fewer time-outs and fewer glares from mommy.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nWhen it comes to child-safety seats, the Mustang falls a bit short. The Latch connectors were buried under the luscious leather; it was difficult for my fingers to find them, but easier for the rigid Latch hooks on my boys’ booster seats to grab onto them. These were the only child-safety seats that fit well back there. Even with the backseat’s bolstering, my boys’ booster seats fit snugly. A buxom bump between their seats actually raised the seat belt receptors up and out making them easy to reach.\n\nWhen installing a rear-facing convertible seat or infant-safety seat, there just wasn’t enough room in the backseat for these space hogs. The front passenger would have to scoot the seat forward a lot to accommodate a rear-facing seat in the back.\n\nI was able to install a forward-facing convertible seat in the backseat without any problems, but the lack of second-row legroom was a concern. This would cause lots of problems for anyone riding in front of this car seat.\n\nThe Mustang has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, traction control and six airbags.\n\nFind more safety information on the 2010 Ford Mustang here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2012 about the 2013 Ford Mustang. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Ford Mustang fit my high school zeitgeist like Friday-night football, Nintendo and Green Day. Kids became expert in cajoling deep-pocketed parents to buy one, and Redmond High’s parking lot held dozens of candy-red coupes and shiny yellow convertibles. Kids idolized their Mustangs — most of which had feckless, relic, pushrod V-6 engines.\n\nFast forward to 2013 and Ford has updated its pony car for the third time in four years, adding a few horses to the 5.0-liter V-8 GT and tweaking the whole lineup’s appearance. Meanwhile, the EPA still rates the Mustang coupe’s 305-horsepower V-6 at 31 mpg on the highway. Knowing what was to come would have blown our minds faster than an AP Calculus final.\n\nThe 2013 Ford Mustang is as raucous as ever, with a gutsy V-6 and a V-8 that pulls like hell.\n\nI’m not sold on all the visual updates, and the interior needs work; so does the coupe’s crashworthiness. But the Mustang still combines scrappy fun with everyday livability, and it should draw buyers even as competition heats up not just from Chevy’s Camaro, but also from Hyundai and Dodge.\n\nStyling, Mechanical Changes\nThis year’s visual updates look more cohesive, more like last year’s V-6 Mustang and shying away from the V-8’s maw-like bumper openings. Compare the two here. The grille has migrated farther forward, and body-colored rocker panels (previously black) add some maturity.\n\nThe Mustang used to have two headlamp arrangements — iconic outboard halogen lamps or lizard-eye xenons that sat inboard. The inboard xenons are now standard. They still look reptilian, but horizontal LED daytime running lamps now flank them. It’s an interesting effect, and the reshaped grille — including a new front air splitter — increases downforce on the Mustang GT, which Ford engineers called “the best V-8 we’ve had by far” in terms of aerodynamics.\n\nStick-shift GT coupes add an optional Track Pack, which combines a 3.73:1 rear axle (versus slower, 2.73 to 3.55 axles for other stick-shift Mustangs) with an engine-oil cooler, an upgraded radio and performance Brembo-brand brakes. They also get a limited-slip Torsen differential from the stupid-fun Boss, with better durability in high-performance situations — like racetracks — than the Mustang’s standard limited-slip differential.\n\nUpgraded Shaker audio systems, a 4.2-inch LCD between the gauges and wider availability of last year’s Recaro sport seats round out the major updates.\n\nFord offers a litany of variants for the rear-drive Mustang, from V-6 and V-8 (GT) coupes and convertibles to a V-8 Mustang Boss 302 coupe. Compare them here. A 650-horsepower Shelby GT500, available as a coupe or convertible, arrives this summer.\n\nTransmissions include a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic that adds manual shifting for 2013. At a media preview, I drove a stick-shift Mustang V-6 coupe with the 2.73 rear axle and a stick-shift GT coupe with the 3.73.\n\nBehind the Wheel\nFord’s 3.7-liter V-6 roars like a V-8, and even with the pokiest (but most fuel-efficient) rear axle, the stick-shift Mustang launches strongly enough to spin the rear tires all the way through 1st gear. The 305-hp drivetrain loses steam as the tach needle swings to redline — territory where the 420-hp Mustang GT shoves you back in your seat.\n\nFriction reductions helped Ford eke out another 8 hp from the 2012’s 5.0-liter V-8, which should match or beat the quarter-mile times of the last Mustang GT that our friends at “MotorWeek” tested: 13 seconds flat. That’s a few tenths of a second faster than a 426-hp Chevrolet Camaro SS.\n\nThe Mustang GT needs premium gas to make full power. Ford says it can run on regular gas, but that drops output down to 402 hp.\n\nFord introduced driver-variable power steering assist last year. Feedback is good in the least-assisted, Sport mode, while Comfort mode makes three-point turns simple to pull off with one palm. (A Normal mode slots between the two.)\n\nThe chassis handles tricky terrain changes well, staying grounded enough over broken pavement to make you forget the Mustang has an outdated solid rear axle.\n\nThe V-6 coupe’s all-season tires yield to mild understeer when turning sharply on wet pavement, but working the tail out only requires easing back on the gas when coming through corners.\n\nOur V-8 tester’s optional Brembo brakes (14-inch front discs, versus 13.2-inchers in lesser GTs) hammered the car to a stop with a lot of forward suspension dive — a peculiar sensation because neither this car nor the softer V-6 suspension exhibited much body roll.\n\nRide quality remains firm but livable, with noticeably more chop in the GT. The Shelby GT500’s chassis, meanwhile, got an available Bilstein adaptive suspension this year; I hope it improves ride control over the prior Shelby’s skittish, sometimes choppy setup.\n\nEPA gas mileage ranges from an excellent 19/31 mpg city/highway in the V-6 automatic to 15/26 mpg in the V-8 manual. The latter figure recalls many SUVs, but it’s comparable to the stick-shift V-8s in the Camaro and Challenger.\n\nNote that higher axle ratios typically trade fuel efficiency for acceleration, and if a certain ratio — or wheel size, for that matter — makes minimal sales, the EPA doesn’t require specific ratings.\n\nThe EPA has yet to rate the Shelby GT500. Here’s how the drivetrains stack up:\n\nMustang Drivetrains Compared\n \tV-6\tGT\tBoss 302\tShelby GT500\nAvailability\tCoupe or convertible\tCoupe or convertible\tCoupe\tCoupe or convertible\nEngine\t3.7-liter V-6\t5.0-liter V-8\t5.0-liter V-8\tSupercharged 5.8-liter V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t305 @ 6,500\t420 @ 6,500\t444 @ 6,500\t650 @ 6,200\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t280 @ 4,250\t390 @ 4,250\t380 @ 4,500\t600 @ 4,250\nTransmissions\t6-speed man.;\n6-speed auto\t6-speed man.;\n6-speed auto\t6-speed man.\t6-speed man.\nAvailable rear axles\tCoupe: 2.73 or 3.31;\nConvertible: 2.73\tCoupe: 3.31, 3.55 or 3.73;\nConvertible: 3.31\t3.73\t3.31\nEPA gas mileage\n(city/highway, mpg)\t19/31 (auto)*,\n19/29 (man.)\t18/25 (auto),\n15/26 (man.)\t15/26\tTBD\nFuel\tRegular\tPremium recommended\tPremium recommended\tPremium required\n*Coupe. The EPA rates automatic convertibles at 19/30 mpg city/highway.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin inconsistencies still mar the interior, where Ford has dressed the dashboard with premium materials but given the doors short shrift. There’s still no telescoping steering wheel, widely offered in other coupes. The optional Recaro seats, previously unavailable in V-6 and GT models, are supportive and comfortable, but they don’t have power adjustments or seat heaters, which the standard buckets offer.\n\nAn available 4.2-inch LCD screen between the gauges can come with Ford’s Racing Apps, which display everything from an accelerometer to the air-fuel mixture entering the engine. It’s entertaining, but adjusting the power-steering assist requires rooting through the LCD’s submenus, which is onerous to do on the fly. Other cars fast-track you to their sportiest settings with dashboard buttons.\n\nThe backseat is tight, but we prefer it over the borderline-unusable backseats in the Camaro and Nissan Altima coupes. Still, if you plan to haul adults around much, the Challenger and Honda Accord coupes are roomier. Trunk space is a generous 13.4 cubic feet, beating the Camaro and both Japanese cars. The Challenger trumps the group, with 16.2 cubic feet.\n\nMustang convertibles have a standard power-retracting top. An optional boot provides a cleaner top-down appearance is optional.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Mustang’s reliability has been average. In crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Mustang coupe earned Good front- and rear-impact scores, but rated only Acceptable in side impacts. (In ascending order, IIHS grades cars Poor, Marginal, Acceptable and Good.) IIHS cited lackluster protection for backseat passengers, but the convertible version scored Good in all three tests. Neither car has undergone IIHS’ roof-crush tests. In the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped crash tests, the Mustang coupe earned four out of five stars overall; NHTSA has yet to test the convertible.\n\nThe Mustang’s so-so ratings are cause for concern — especially in an age where the vast majority of cars earn top IIHS ratings — but there are few models with which it can be compared. Due to limited sales, most coupes aren’t crash-tested. The Challenger and coupe versions of the Accord and Altima are among them. The Camaro coupe earned five stars from NHTSA, but IIHS has yet to test it. Standard safety features include front and side-impact airbags for the front seats, but there are no side curtain airbags — a feature every major competitor has. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard. Click here to see all safety features.\n\nStick-shift V-6 coupes start well-equipped at $22,000. At the other end, a loaded Shelby GT500 convertible runs more than three times that. Options include power front seats, heated leather upholstery, automatic climate control, navigation and Ford’s Sync with AppLink, which streams Bluetooth audio and smartphone applications like Pandora and Stitcher internet radio.\n\nMustang in the Market\nDetroit’s muscle cars combined for nearly 200,000 sales last year, proving that sports cars still appeal even amid a shaky economic recovery. Camaro sales outpaced the Mustang, but the ‘Stang outsold everyone else. It ought to: For its performance value, the Mustang deserves admiration from kids and parents alike. The venerable Ford turns 50 next year, and the changes this year should help it meet that threshold at full steam.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "One nagging question kept creeping into my mind while I was roaring around in the Ford Mustang Bullitt:\n\nDo I really feel like Steve McQueen?\n\nThe answer: a reluctant no.\n\nHowever, there was another, more important question: Is the 2001 Bullitt a good stand-in for Steve McQueen’s 1968 Mustang GT 390 fastback, made famous in moviedom’s most celebrated car chase? Of course, that’s the 1968 movie of the same name, Bullitt, which contained the eight-minute chase sequence pitting tough-guy detective Frank Bullitt (McQueen) in the dark-green Mustang against two bad guys in a Dodge Charger.\n\nFlying, crashing, screeching sideways across intersections, cascading down hilly streets in San Francisco. The Charger lost seven hubcaps. The bad guys came to a bad end. Hard to beat, really.\n\nClever Ford designers and marketers knew there was some real value here. So apropos of nothing, except maybe the 33rd anniversary of Bullitt, Ford came out with a trim and suspension package for Mustang GT that creates a modern facsimile of the classic ‘Stang.\n\nFor gearhead boomers of a certain age (such as mine), the Mustang Bullitt resonates with nostalgia. But it also beats with contemporary practicality. There’s a snorting V-8, though certainly not the massive 390 cubic-inch mill that powered the original; a quick-shifting manual tranny, though now with five speeds instead of four; and a stiffened suspension, though modern shocks and springs tame the ride.\n\nThe brakes are now four-wheel disc, with bright-red calipers visible between the spokes of the 17-inch modular wheels. Naturally, braking, handling and steering response are much improved after 33 years of technical improvements. Cornering can still get loose, thanks to the Mustang’s solid rear axle, like the original. Only the upscale Mustang Cobra has independent rear suspension.\n\nAbout those wheels: They look remarkably like the wheels on McQueen’s ’68 fastback. They are my favorite visual aspect of the Bullitt, set off against the same dark-green shade of the original. Bullitt is also available in dark blue or black, but dark green is the real deal.\n\nThe Bullitt package is a $3,695 enhancement of the Mustang GT, including body, trim, mechanical and suspension changes that boost the power, performance and visual impact of the basic Mustang. About 6,500 Mustang Bullitts were made for the 2001 model year only, but Ford says there are still some left.\n\nOutside, the Bullitt edition is easy to spot, with its massive hood scoop (absent on the ’68 original), unique side moldings that echo the original, the lowered suspension, dual chrome tailpipes and, of course, those wheels.\n\nThe roof and rear pillar have been altered slightly to give some of the effect of the ’68 fastback. A racy aluminum fuel filler has been added, but it looks tacky and out of place.\n\nThe engine puts out 265 horsepower, just five more than the basic 4.6-liter V-8, but the torque hits a significant 305 pound-feet. That translates into real launching power and a feeling of immediate engine response at any speed.\n\nThe engine rumbles ominously at idle, and there’s a thunderous roar under acceleration, very reminiscent of muscle-car sound effects. Acceleration is strong, but the ’68 390 would run away from it, though guzzling more fuel and spewing more fumes.\n\nOn the freeway, Bullitt lopes easily at 75 mph-plus, the rumbling exhaust note making it feel powerful and exotic. The stiff ride isn’t exactly harsh, but it can get jarring.\n\nThe five-speed is great fun to upshift and downshift, especially gripping the big aluminum ball on top of the floor shift. A downside of that silver ball is the hand-branding effect after it’s been sitting under the sun for awhile.\n\nhe interior is tight but comfortable up front, imposs y cramped in back. Hey, it’s a sports coupe, not a sedan.\n\nBut does Bullitt work as a modern equivalent of the McQueen original? In most ways, yes, and in some ways, better. But still, it’s hard to recapture the aggressive style of the ’68 Mustang GT, a true muscle-car classic.",

      "expert_review": "When is enough enough? For Ford’s SVT performance-vehicle team, the 2013 Shelby GT500 provides the answer, and it’s a resounding “never.” There’s no other conclusion after driving this muscle-car creation. It gained 112 horsepower for 2013, making for an incredible 662 hp total from its supercharged V-8.\n\nThe 2013 Ford Shelby GT500 is an unruly beast, an automotive hooligan — and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe Shelby GT500 coupe starts at $54,995 including a $795 destination charge, and the convertible lists for $5,000 more. A number of performance-oriented options raised the price of our test coupe to $63,080. The Shelby GT500’s base price is a few hundred dollars below that of its prime competitor, the 580-hp Chevrolet Camaro ZL1. To see these 2013 cars’ specs compared side by side, along with the 2012 Shelby GT500, click here.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nDriving the Shelby GT500 requires a certain level of restraint from your right foot. The rear end readily swerves to the side if you jab the gas pedal — even on warm tires and dry roads. Though the rear steps out willingly — even with all the electronic safety features on — it happens in a predictable way, and it’s easy enough to quell the motions by backing off the gas.\n\nThat controllable nature of the 2013 Shelby GT500 is one of the key qualities that make it better than its predecessor, which was skittish and prone to snap oversteer. Abrupt, uneven power delivery from that car’s supercharged V-8 didn’t help matters, either.\n\nMaking the car’s tail squirm and wiggle never gets old, but the lack of grip makes it difficult to take full advantage of the considerable power at your disposal — 662 hp at 6,500 rpm and 631 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. It’s a constant battle to keep the rear tires hooked up. The Camaro ZL1’s rear tires are nearly an inch wider, and a larger contact patch could help check some of the Shelby GT500’s power-delivery issues.\n\nThe Shelby GT500’s baritone exhaust note is fitting, and it won praise from our editors. Mash the gas pedal, and the primal, lion-like roar is a perfect match for the car’s thrilling power.\n\nThe high-performance powertrain doesn’t make the Shelby GT500 difficult to drive in stop-and-go traffic, though you’ll get more of a workout than you would with a regular Mustang GT. The clutch pedal is quite a bit firmer, but it doesn’t take long to learn where the clutch engages, and there’s enough slippage to make smooth starts second-nature.\n\nLike the clutch pedal, there’s a lot of tension in the six-speed manual transmission’s shifter, much more than the Mustang GT’s manual. Short throws engage each gear with an uncommon level of mechanical precision.\n\nEPA gas mileage estimates for the Shelby GT500 are 15/24/18 mpg city/highway/combined, which improves on the 2012 model by 1 mpg in both highway and combined driving, despite the 112-hp gain. Ford boasts that the Shelby GT500 is exempt from any gas-guzzler tax. That’s true, but after a week in the Cars.com garage, the car’s average fuel economy stood at 14 mpg. That was a result of enthusiastic miles, to be sure, but it meant frequent trips to the gas station, as the Shelby GT500’s tank holds only 16 gallons.\n\nThe car comes with a Brembo-brand brake system that includes discs that measure 15 inches across in front and 13.8 inches in back, with six-piston front calipers and single-piston rear ones. The brakes bite hard early and offer admirable linearity across the pedal’s range of motion.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Shelby GT500’s track-mindedness comes through in its suspension tuning. Our car had the optional Performance Package, which includes SVT-tuned Bilstein dampers with two modes: Normal and Sport. The package also adds a limited-slip differential, unique wheels and special rear springs.\n\nEven in Normal mode, the ride is firm by most standards, producing a pronounced jounce when you hit a bump. The car quickly settles itself after such a hit, but Chicago roads are rarely smooth for more than a couple feet, and the suspension picked up all their imperfections. Sport mode makes the ride even less forgiving.\n\nThe ride is significantly firmer than a Mustang GT’s, and I wonder if Ford has gone too firm with the Shelby GT500’s Normal mode. It’d be nice if one of the settings were comfort-oriented, but as it stands there’s hardly enough difference between the two modes to warrant a button to select between them. Their similarity means this car is definitely at the edge of everyday drivability if you spend many miles on compromised city pavement.\n\nThat said, the GT500 drives well on the highway. It settles in nicely around 70 mph, and you can’t feel the movements of the live rear axle like you can in the regular Mustang.\n\nThere’s a nimbleness to the Shelby GT500 that’s missing from the Camaro and Dodge Challenger. Steering turn-in is quick and immediate, though it happens without much road feel. It’s an electrically assisted system and it includes three modes — Standard, Sport and Comfort — that vary the amount of power assistance. Like the suspension, the difference between the steering modes is minimal, and more variation would be welcome.\n\nThe Shelby GT500 is smaller than the Camaro and Challenger, and you’ll feel that in corners, but it’s not engaging like a Porsche Cayman S. It’s still a muscle car, even if it is a modern one.\n\nThe Inside\nOne of the Shelby GT500’s pleasant surprises is cabin visibility. The front roof pillars are relatively upright, yielding great forward views, and over-right-shoulder visibility is good, too. It shows that you needn’t have terrible visibility (like the Camaro does) in order to have a stylish car.\n\nOne of the Shelby GT500’s subtle highlights is its ability to manage wind rush. Cruising on the highway with the windows down results in plenty of cabin turbulence in most cars, but this car’s interior is remarkably calm by comparison. The rear wheel wells could use more sound-deadening material, however, because you can clearly hear road debris bouncing off the underbody.\n\nThe optional Recaro front seats are another high point that drew praise from numerous editors. Available for $1,595, the bucket seats offer an ideal blend of comfort and support, with large side bolsters to keep you in place in fast corners. The integrated head restraints were fine by us, but some drivers might prefer a height adjustment.\n\nThe backseat could be usable for taller adults if headroom weren’t so limited. I’m 6-foot-1 and had to sit with my head tilted to the side; I couldn’t sit straight up without bumping into the rear window. It wouldn’t have been a problem if I were a few inches shorter, but the Challenger’s backseat is more accommodating.\n\nInterior quality is a mixed bag. The upper section of the interior features a padded dashboard and an overall premium appearance, but glance down at the hard shiny plastic center console, and the drop-off in quality is immediately apparent. Panel fit could also be better.\n\nInstrument legibility is another shortcoming. Though not as bad as the retro script of the regular Mustang’s gauges, the tight hash mark and number spacing makes it hard to check your speed at a glance — vitally important in a car like this. The configurable instrument lighting — a Mustang signature feature — lets you specify the backlighting color, but it can’t help the cramped gauge layout. The speedometer and tachometer needles are tiny, too.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Mustang coupe received the best score, Good, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s primary frontal crash test, and the second-best rating, Acceptable, in the side-impact crash test (the Mustang convertible was rated Good). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also tested the Mustang coupe, giving it four out of five stars overall and a five-star rollover rating.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. There are also standard side-impact airbags for the front seats that include head-protection extensions. For a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nShelby GT500 in the Market\nFuel-efficient and alternative-energy vehicles have been the stars of the car world the past few years, but a horsepower war has also been quietly raging among carmakers, and the 2013 Shelby GT500 is perhaps the most audacious effort to date. It’s as if the car exists in a universe parallel to Ford’s other products, promoted as they are for their fuel efficiency and green cred.\n\nEvery car has a mission, whether it’s a Chevrolet Suburban or a Nissan Leaf. The Shelby GT500’s mission is a pretty obvious one — extreme performance, straight from the factory — and after driving the car there’s only one conclusion: Mission accomplished.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "In the past, Ford has made special-edition Mustangs not so special, giving them mild performance tweaks, custom paint jobs and not much else. The Boss 302 is not one of those Mustangs.\n\nTrack-ready yet fun for the street, the 2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 is a pure performance machine that may be the best version of the classic car I’ve driven. And it comes topped with a wicked custom paint job.\n\nThe Boss 302 sits amid a wide array of 2012 Mustang trim levels, including the base V6 that starts at $22,310, the 5.0-liter V-8 GT model that starts at $29,310, and the top-of-the-line supercharged V-8 Shelby GT500, which runs $48,810. The Boss starts at $40,310, falling between the GT and Shelby but so impressive that the GT500 seems like overkill. See them compared.\n\nBare Bones Performance, Bare Bones Car\nIn today’s auto market, even new subcompacts come loaded with advanced gadgetry of all kinds. Not the Boss 302.\n\nThe basic black interior is devoid of frills. There’s no stereo upgrade, no Sync multimedia system, no navigation. That’s because Boss buyers only care about what’s under the hood and under their backsides.\n\nThe 5.0-liter V-8 engine that supplies the GT with 412 horsepower gets an upgrade to 444 horses in the Boss, using revised camshafts and intakes. There’s also a quad exhaust system with two pipes heading out the back, as usual, and two side pipes exiting just in front of the rear wheels. The system generates an exhaust note so gratifying you’ll never even turn on the rental-car-grade stereo.\n\nOur test car was optioned with a $1,995 package that included a limited-slip differential and Recaro-brand sport seats. The seats were the lone comfort feature. Wider than most Recaros I’ve tested and with the right amount of support and bolstering for my frame, I fell in love … with a seat. So did the rest of the Cars.com staff, as well as my wife, who generally blanches at the thought of climbing into the sports cars I test. (Honestly, she will never get into another Corvette Z06.) If you don’t get the optional “RECARO Seat & TORSEN Differential Package,” you’re missing out.\n\nThe Boss returns mileage of 17 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway, which is identical to the GT’s mileage with a manual transmission. The Boss is only available with a six-speed manual.\n\nPutting the Power to the Pavement\nThe Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 is the most powerful Mustang, with 550 hp, but all the Cars.com editors agreed that the Boss does a better job of putting all its power to the road. All the performance upgrades come together so seamlessly that the Boss feels like the pure essence of what a car should be.\n\nA cue-ball-style knob tops the manual six-speed shifter, giving drivers a unique feel when going through the gears, although it can get slippery if your palms are sweaty. Ford calls it a short-throw shifter, but that’s only true if you compare it with other Fords. It was good, but it could have even shorter throws and be more precise.\n\nThe shifter/clutch combo was a highlight for our other editors, too. The clutch features upgraded materials to reduce wear at the extremes this car will likely experience, and it also means your left leg won’t go through a “Biggest Loser”-style workout in gridlock traffic.\n\nPower is always important, and the V-8 erupts at the touch of your right foot, moving out from a stop with limited rear-wheel slippage. Lots of car enthusiasts like to squeal tires for the seat-of-the-pants sensation it provides, but I like to get off the line as perfectly as possible. I’m not often perfect, but the Boss 302 sure helps. Now, 444 horses is a lot of power, so when you decide to push it hard from 1st to 2nd gear, the back end can easily come loose, which is disconcerting for even the most experienced driver. But getting the rear wheels to settle down is a natural correction in the Boss, which illustrates just how good — no, let’s just say how awesome — it is.\n\nAnd don’t forget, all this performance pleasure is topped off by the sound of that exhaust system.\n\nWhen you hit a classic car show and hear the rumbling of decades-old monsters of sheet metal, it elicits memories of a bygone era of muscle. But all that rumbling doesn’t necessarily mean these classics are machines superior to modern sports cars. The Boss’ exhaust brings that same classic aural resonation — with a hint of IMSA racecar mixed in — but does so teamed to a car that is light years beyond any stock classic, no matter how well it’s been restored.\n\nIt’s Track Ready, Too\nI’ve driven the Boss 302 on the street, where it performs as ably as any high-performance car out there. On rough pavement in downtown and suburban Chicago, it was more comfortable than plenty of other cars I’ve tested. The Recaros helped.\n\nBut the Boss 302 can go from the street to the track with the turn of a key. Literally. It’s called TracKey, and it’s red where the car’s everyday key is black.\n\nThere’s a second set of engine-control software that comes with the dealer-installed TracKey option. It increases low-end torque and engine braking and makes the throttle even more responsive. We also thought the side exhaust sounded better in that mode.\n\nAll Boss 302s come with a manually adjustable suspension system — no TracKey required. With the system, drivers use a small screwdriver-like tool to adjust each shock absorber. The settings range from one to five, with one being the softest suspension and five being the most severe for the track. We tested our Boss 302 on the factory setting of two and found it comfortable for everyday use, while still being impressive in tight turns. This was certainly the best handling Mustang I’ve ever piloted. \n\nBoss 302 Laguna Seca\nIf you’re a real track aficionado — meaning you race routinely — Ford builds a limited number of Boss 302 Laguna Seca models that are not meant for regular street use. In those models, the backseat is replaced with a large X-brace to stiffen the body. The adjustable suspension is even more aggressive than the standard Boss’, and there’s an aero-kit for the front bumper. Lightweight wheels are also part of the package, which costs an additional $6,995. Again, that’s a limited model for serious racers.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the 2011 and 2012 Mustang rated Good in frontal crashes and Acceptable in side crashes. It did not undergo rear tests or roof-strength tests. The Boss 302 features the same safety equipment as other Mustangs, including antilock brakes, stability control, seat-mounted side airbags and curtain airbags. You can see a full list of safety features here.\n\nBoss 302 in the Market\nThe Mustang remains a competitive car compared with the Chevy Camaro and Dodge Challenger. In Boss 302 guise, it has no equal that I’ve tested, and certainly none for $40,000.\n\nIt’s rare to find a vehicle that feels so natural to drive. The BMW M3 is probably my favorite in this regard, but the Boss 302 is as close as any car has come.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord’s “pony car” celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2004, and all models wear special commemorative front-fender badging. A limited-edition 40th Anniversary Package that features performance-oriented upgrades and Arizona Beige stripes on the hood, lower rockers and deck lid is available.\n\nLast year saw the return of the limited-production Mach 1 Mustang, which first debuted in 1969. Continuing into 2004, the current version has a functional “shaker” scoop on its hood as well as an air-dam extension and low-gloss black striping above the rocker moldings. Not only has the Mach 1’s body been lowered by half an inch, but its 4.6-liter V-8 engine is also good for 305 horsepower. An SVT version of the Mustang called the Mustang Cobra is also available. (Skip to details on the: SVT Mustang Cobra)\n\nCoupes and convertibles are available. Regular V-6 Mustangs come in standard, Deluxe and Premium trim levels, while the GT V-8 is offered in Deluxe and Premium levels.\n\nFord’s Mustang is the last of the traditional rear-wheel-drive pony cars. At the 2004 North American International Auto Show, Ford introduced a brand-new Mustang that will go on sale as a 2005 model-year vehicle.\n\nExterior\nEven in the tamer, V-6-powered trim levels, the Mustang flaunts a sporty appearance with its long hood and short rear deck. Several styling cues, including the hood scoop, side scoops and a grille that contains a pony emblem in a chrome corral, are evolutions of the Mustang’s appearance from more than three decades ago. Convertibles have a glass back window and a power-operated top that stows beneath a hard boot.\n\nInterior\nMustangs seat four occupants on front bucket seats and a split, folding rear seat; the seatback is fixed in convertibles. Seating is reasonably upright for easy entry and exit, but the doors demand considerable space in order to be fully opened. Cargo volumes are a modest 10.9 cubic feet in the coupe and 7.7 cubic feet in convertible models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase-model Mustangs carry a 190-hp, 3.8-liter V-6 engine, while the GT gets a 4.6-liter single-overhead-cam V-8 rated at 260 hp. Either engine can team with a five-speed-manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic. With the manual shift, the Mach 1’s 4.6-liter V-8 generates 305 hp at 5,800 rpm and 320 pounds-feet of torque at 4,200 rpm. A limited-slip rear axle is standard on GT models.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard on the Mach 1 and SVT Mustang Cobra and optional on other models. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWhether it packs a V-6 or V-8 engine, the Mustang is a strong performer, yet it’s easy enough to live with for everyday driving due to its relatively smooth ride and quiet operation.\n\nHandling is another bonus, especially when driving a GT. Steering demands moderate effort, but you get firm, secure responses and a tenacious grip through curves. The GT’s V-8 delivers a satisfying exhaust sound. Ford’s five-speed-manual gearbox isn’t always the easiest to shift, and some of them have made a clanking sound.\n\nRelated Model: SVT Mustang Cobra\nRevived as a 2003 model, the SVT Mustang Cobra dishes out more power than any of its predecessors — 390 hp at 6,000 rpm and 390 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. The extra horsepower on the current version results from an Eaton Roots-type supercharger that features a water-to-air intercooler for the 4.6-liter V-8 engine. A six-speed-manual transmission sends all the Cobra’s vigor to the back wheels.\n\nCoupe and convertible body styles are available, but the soft-top Cobra has its own suspension tuning. The Cobra is capable of accelerating from zero to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds.\n\nFor 2004, 1,000 examples of a limited-edition Mystichrome Appearance Package, which features color-shifting body paint, will be produced. Two new regular colors are available: Screaming Yellow and Competition Orange. Ford halted the production of all SVT products midway through the model year, but a new group is expected in a year or so. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "A Dance on the Daring Side\n2003 Roush 380R Mustang\n\nI’m driving a 2003 Roush 380R Mustang convertible, black clearcoat with gold racing stripes running through the trunk lid and hood, with matching stripes along the rocker panels — a hot car, as bad as it wants to be.\n\nI’m driving with the top down on a spring day not quite spring and wondering about Iris Krasnow, the woman who writes those “surrendering” books — “Surrendering to Marriage” and “Surrendering to Motherhood” and “Surrendering to Self.”\n\nI’m driving and wishing that Krasnow could find a way to interview Old Man Winter and ask him why he refuses to surrender to spring.\n\nWearing a black suede jacket over a thick sweater takes the joy out of driving with the top down, but I’m making the best of it, and I’ve brought along singers Ray Charles and Nina Simone to help.\n\nThey are on discs popped into the 380R Mustang’s dash-mounted, six-disc CD player. They are good in that place, where I think I can keep them forever — even Nina, who died recently but strums my heart with her music nonetheless.\n\nRay and his singers are telling me to “Hit the Road, Jack,” and I’m having no problem doing that in this Mustang, which is no ordinary Ford Mustang, not in the least.\n\nIt’s a Roush Mustang , a motorized conjuration by Jack Roush, a recalcitrant race-car-driver-turned-entrepreneur, who turns out super-powerful, super-fast Mustangs at Roush Performance Products in Livonia, Mich.\n\nRoush has outdone himself, pumping up this pony car with a supercharged 4.6-liter single-overhead-cam V-8. The engine develops 379 horsepower at 5,250 revolutions per minute and 380 foot-pounds of torque at 3,000 rpm — which means nothing until you hit the accelerator. Whooossshhh! The car moves from 0 to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds!\n\nPower in the tested 380R Mustang is transmitted to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual, Roush-designed gearshift, which is unlike any manual shifter I’ve used. It is shaped differently from the usual rod types. It is rectangular, broad and slightly curved at the bottom, but narrow and straight at the top, on which sits a gearshift knob so perfectly sculpted it becomes a part of your hand.\n\nShift throws are short in first and second gears, a tad longer in third, and longer but still snappy in fourth and fifth. Working that lever is like dancing to New Orleans jazz — bop, bop, bop-bop, diddy, diddy-bop.\n\nYou can get a four-speed automatic transmission with this one. Not everyone likes to shift. Not everyone likes to dance. But, for me, having an automatic transmission in a 380R Mustang is akin to partying at a convent, where you’re a lot less likely to let the good times roll. What kind of fun is that in a car designed to roll like a demon, or as my songstress college classmate Wanda Rouzan likes to sing, “tear da roof off da sucka”?\n\nWhat ca n I say? Raising hell is sometimes a good thing. It puts propriety into perspective and, at least momentarily, allows you to surrender to something more enjoyable, exciting, even dangerous.\n\nThat is why I’m driving the 380R with its big-whoosh engine, 18-inch-diameter wheels, BFG G-Force KD tires and monster-grip brakes (Roush-altered Alcon brakes — 14-inch rotors with four-piston calipers up front and 13-inch rotors with two-piston calipers in the rear).\n\nIt is wonderfully outrageous. It is about the freedom so many of us are afraid to embrace, because doing so involves risks.\n\nBut life without risks is life without freedom.\n\nJack Roush understands that.\n\nNina Simone certainly did.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: All that power, all that speed, so few roads on which to use it. Also, this is a very pricey Mustang.\n\nPraise: The roads and other places, such as Summit Point Raceway in Summit Point, W.Va., where you can enjoy the Roush 380R Mustang to its fullest. This is the muscle car as muscle cars were meant to be.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Oh, baby! This thing can move with speed and grace. It handles excellently in curves. No detectable body sway. Credit the Roush-selected suspension pieces — shocks, struts, springs, lightweight aluminum control arms, and front sway bar.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Every stoplight brought a favorable comment from some man or woman who knew something about Roush Mustangs. “That’s a Roush! A real Roush!” Yeah, you betcha. Somebody’s gotta do this job.\n\nLayout/design: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-door convertible; convertible top has manual-release headers, automatic lower and lift operation. The 380R also comes as a hardtop coupe.\n\nCapacities: Mustang convertibles are notable for their ability to seat four adults comfortably. This one is no different. Trunk can hold two small, crushable bags.\n\nMileage: With the five-speed manual transmission, the Roush 380R Mustang has an Environmental Protection Agency rating of 17 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway. I averaged 23 mpg in highway travel.\n\nSafety: Dual front air bags, standard anti-lock brakes and precision handling to help you avoid trouble in the first place.\n\nPrice: The price is $55,624, including $28,965 for the base Mustang GT and $26,659 for the Roush modifications and equipment.\n\nPurse-strings note: Only 200 Roush 380R Mustang coupes and convertibles are being built for 2003. There are few bargains on this one at the dealership. You might have better luck finding a more favorable price online.",
