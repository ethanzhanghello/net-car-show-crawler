      "expert_review": "When I hear “Jaguar,” I visualize driving to the ballet decked out in diamonds and a mink coat. How bad could it be living that fantasy for a while? My personal reality is quite different, however. I do drive to the ballet on a regular basis (although it’s my 4-year-old’s ballet class), and I’m usually dressed to kill in jeans, a tank top and flip flops. I’m a bit skeptical as to whether this fancy, high-society car “inspired by over 70 years of legendary performance and design” can fit into my very ordinary life as a suburban mom.\n\nMy first obstacle to overcome is the Latch connectors. They’re so tightly wedged into the crevasse between the seat back and bottom that they’re really not accessible. Note to automotive manufacturers: Test your Latch connectors. If you can’t use them, neither can we. I fall back on using seat belts to install the car seats.\n\nI realize that not every mom wants to drive a minivan or an SUV. The problem with smaller cars such as this one is that I risk head injury every time I buckle my kids in. I am able to duck low enough to avoid hitting my head on the roofline, but now I need a live-in chiropractor.\n\nAlso, the small amount of legroom in the rear makes installing a rear-facing infant seat difficult at best. For those of you with older children or no children at all, this certainly won’t be an issue for you.\n\nOpening the trunk, I’m impressed with how much space there appears to be. It seams that appearances are everything with this car. The “luggage” compartment turns out to be just that. It has tons of room to store Gucci bags for a trip to the Hamptons, but anything odd-shaped (or practical), like a jogging stroller or a double stroller, won’t fit.\n\nAdjusting the driver’s seat to accommodate me is easy thanks to the telescoping steering wheel. Like all busy moms, I catch an occasional case of “mommy Jell-O brain,” and today is my turn. Inserting the key into the ignition takes several tries. The odd-shaped key makes it difficult to figure out which way to put it in.\n\nOn a short drive to our local pool, I quickly realize that the narrow body design of the Jaguar X-Type places my children too close to one another for comfort. They spend the entire five-minute drive poking, prodding, pinching, grabbing snacks and sippy cups, and otherwise making each other’s lives (and my own) miserable. I confiscate the cups only to discover that they won’t fit in the cupholders.\n\nWhile I don’t need it on this short trip, the touch-screen navigation system surprisingly proves to be user-friendly. The graphics are clearly labeled and easy on the eyes. I also like the touch-screen audio function. It’s easy to program my favorite radio channels.\n\nGetting back into the car after a few hours at the pool (the Jag parked in the blazing hot sun) reveals an important issue: Don’t waste your money to upgrade to a woodgrain steering wheel. It’s so hot I literally can’t touch it. We have to sit in the car with the air conditioning blasting for 10 minutes before I can drive without getting third-degree burns.\n\nSo maybe the Jaguar X-Type 3.0 isn’t very functional for me and my family. I recognize, however, that every woman has her own idea of a perfect car. It’s possible (though unlikely) that this one’s for you.\n\n*For more information on the Jaguar X-Type and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "Mention the words ”Jaguar” and ”station wagon” in the same breath, and most people will look at you as if they swallowed something foul.\n\nCertainly, there isn’t anything in Jaguar’s heritage remotely resembling what Brits call an estate or shooting brake.\n\nBut the new 2006 Jaguar X-Type 3-liter Sportwagon should hit the sweet spot in the entry-level luxury market, starting right around $36,000.\n\nThat’s similar to all-wheel-drive competitors such as Audi and Volvo, the latter a corporate cousin of Jaguar.\n\nThat said, you might wonder why this model hasn’t been more popular. Certainly, there aren’t many parked at the McMansions springing up on farm fields across the region.\n\nMaybe it’s because the X-Type is well-known for its origins as a European Ford, which diminishes the Jaguar pedigree no matter what engineering went on under the hood.\n\nMaybe its the dismal marketing that has done little to let people know that this model exists.\n\nWhatever the reason, this is a very pleasant little luxury wagon.\n\nInitially, X-Types came with a choice of V6 engines, either a 2.5-liter or a 3-liter, mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or five-speed automatic.\n\nBut sales of the model have been in a free-fall. So, for 2006, the 3-liter 262-horsepower V6 mated to a five-speed automatic that can be shifted manually is the sole powertrain.\n\nIt accelerates confidently and fluidly, the way a Jaguar should. The automatic seemed indecisive at times — not the sort of behavior you would expect.\n\nTraction was excellent, even in mucky weather. Cornering and braking were quite good.\n\nThe little Jag is fitted with disc brakes all around, as well as fully independent suspension, as a Jag should.\n\nManeuverability is good and the X-Type has a small turning radius, Certainly it behaves with all the ability of a Jaguar, and it feels like one, despite the practical shape.\n\nAh yes, the shape.\n\nThe lines of this shooting brake lend the car a gorgeous look that the X-Type sedan doesn’t have.\n\nIt also allows you to carry quite a bit of cargo, with its 50 cubic feet with the seats folded. Up front, a wire mesh grille borrowed from the Jaguar’s R-type performance line gives the diminutive grille a racy appearance.\n\nWhile the interior has all the expected conveniences, look closer and you’ll be surprised.\n\nThere were seat heaters, a GPS system and an AM/FM/CD audio system that played a single CD at a time. Amazingly, a CD changer is optional. The car is prewired for an integrated cell phone.\n\nThe seats are firm yet comfortable and do a good job of holding occupants in place during sporty maneuvers.\n\nFront seat space is good. That said, the rear seat accommodations seem a bit short of legroom.\n\nThere’s the expected Jaguar switchgear, as well as the requisite wood trim. However, there’s quite a bit of hard plastic, more than there should be on a prestige make.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nSo why is this such an underwhelming experience?\n\nIt just feels gussied-up, like an aging matron trying for Britney-like youthful exuberance. You want to believe, but somehow it all fails to come together.\n\nJaguar has been more successful with its larger cars, with maintaining the marque’s feel and heritage.\n\nThat said, the X-Type Sportwagon seems to be the best model in the X-Type lineup.\n\nAnd while the X-Type is superior to lesser cars of the same size, such as the Subaru Legacy GT Wagon, it’s just so-so when compared to its luxury competition.\n\nWhile Jaguar makes some great cars, this one is just ordinary.\n\nlprintz@mcall.com\n\n610-820-6713",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJaguar adds more standard equipment, including stability control, a moonroof and rear park assist (for the wagon), to its X-Type for 2007. The automaker has also juggled its naming conventions, dropping the Sport package and replacing the VDP and Premium packages with a luxury package on the sedan.\n\nEquipped with all-wheel drive, the X-Type is related to the Ford-built European Mondeo. An automatic transmission is standard on all models. Wheel center caps and the steering wheel display black Growler badging, and Sirius Satellite Radio and Bluetooth wireless technology are available.\n\nAn X-Type 3.0 Sportwagon joined the original four-door compact sedan for 2005.\n(Skip to details on the: X-Type 3.0 Sportwagon)\n\nExterior\nProportion and balance are important in the X-Type’s design. Designers substituted a high tail for the traditional low tail of the past. The X-Type’s classic styling themes are familiar to Jaguar aficionados and include a traditional forward-leaning grille augmented by some sporty modern touches. Elliptical quad halogen headlights are installed, and fog lights are integrated into the lower front fascia.\n\nJaguar’s Dynamic Stability Control electronic stability system is standard. The X-Type rides on 16-inch alloy wheels, and 17-inch wheels are optional.\n\nThe luxury package includes a unique 17-inch wheel design and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nInterior\nFive people fit in the cockpit-style interior, which features Connolly leather and traditional wood veneer or carbon-fiber trim, depending on the model. Standard equipment includes automatic climate control and steering-wheel controls for the stereo.\n\nThe luxury package offers leather-trimmed seats, burl walnut interior trim and 10-way power-adjustable driver and front passenger seats.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEach X-Type is powered by a 227-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 that teams with a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include dual-stage front airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants, and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBecause it’s structurally related to the Ford Mondeo, many have wondered whether the X-Type is an authentic Jaguar. It’s an eager-performing, competent-handling sedan that’s able to carry on the company’s illustrious heritage.\n\nOn wet, twisty pavement, the X-Type demonstrates its handling skills at every curve. Responding quickly and surely to steering inputs, the sedan is confident and surefooted at all speeds. Even on moderately imperfect surfaces, the ride is sheer pleasure. Rougher patches can produce some jostling, but the car corrects itself crisply without excessive rebounding.\n\nAcceleration with the 3.0-liter V-6 is vigorous, supremely confident and helped by crisp automatic-transmission operation. Exceptionally quiet, the X-Type exhibits evidence of solid, careful construction. The seats are comfortable and supportive.\n\nX-Type 3.0 Sportwagon\nWhen the Sportwagon went on sale in Europe, it wasn’t clear when — or if — that body style would reach American dealerships. Late in 2004, Jaguar was ready to send it across the Atlantic. Though it’s similar to the sedan up front, the Sportwagon has different rear doors and a unique roof. For 2007, the Sportwagon gains its own 17-inch wheels and standard rear park assist.\n\nEquipped with the 227-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 and an automatic transmission, the all-wheel-drive Sportwagon has a rear window that can be opened. The folding backseat is split 70/30. Four luggage tie-downs are installed in the rear cargo area, which includes a luggage cover and cargo net. A hidden storage compartment includes a 12-volt power outlet and detachable side doors. Silver roof rails are fitted for use with adjustable carrying systems, and a moonroof is standard.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 2008 Jaguar X-Type gets more standard luxury features for the new model year and keeps its streamlined naming convention from 2007. The engine, drivetrain and many of the mechanical features remain unchanged from the previous year.\n\nAll-wheel drive and a five-speed automatic transmission are standard on all models. New standard equipment includes 10-way powered driver and passenger seats, memory settings for the driver’s seat and side mirror, and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nAn X-Type 3.0 Sportwagon joined the original four-door sedan for 2005.\n(Skip to details on the: X-Type 3.0 Sportwagon)\n\nExterior\nProportion and balance are important in the X-Type’s design. Designers substituted a high tail for the traditional low tail of the past. The X-Type’s styling themes are familiar to Jaguar aficionados and include a forward-leaning grille augmented by some sporty modern touches. Elliptical quad halogen headlights are installed, and fog lights are integrated into the lower front face.\n\nJaguar’s Dynamic Stability Control electronic stability system is standard. The X-Type rides on 16-inch alloy wheels, and 17-inch wheels are optional.\n\nThe luxury package (created thanks to Jaguar’s streamlined naming convention) includes a unique 17-inch wheel design, chrome door mirror caps and automatic on/off headlamps.\n\nInterior\nFive people fit in the cockpit-style interior, which features Connolly leather and traditional wood veneer or carbon-fiber trim, depending on the model. New standard features for 2008 include 10-way powered driver and passenger seats, memory settings for the driver’s seat and side mirror, and a self-dimming rearview mirror. Automatic climate control is also standard.\n\nThe luxury package offers leather-trimmed seats and burl walnut interior trim.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEach X-Type is powered by a 227-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 that teams with a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include dual-stage front airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants, and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution. An electronic stability system is also standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBecause it’s structurally related to the old Ford Mondeo, many have wondered whether the X-Type is an authentic Jaguar. It’s an eager-performing, competent-handling sedan that’s able to carry on the company’s illustrious heritage.\n\nOn wet, twisty pavement, the X-Type demonstrates its handling skills at every curve. Responding quickly and surely to steering inputs, the sedan is confident and surefooted at all speeds. Even on moderately imperfect surfaces, the ride is sheer pleasure. Rougher patches can produce some jostling, but the car corrects itself crisply without excessive rebounding.\n\nAcceleration with the 3.0-liter V-6 is vigorous, supremely confident and helped by crisp automatic-transmission operation. Exceptionally quiet, the X-Type exhibits evidence of solid, careful construction. The seats are comfortable and supportive.\n\nX-Type 3.0 Sportwagon\nWhen the Sportwagon went on sale in Europe, it wasn’t clear when — or if — that body style would reach American dealerships. Late in 2004, Jaguar was ready to send it across the Atlantic. Though it’s similar to the sedan up front, the Sportwagon has different rear doors and a unique roof. For 2008, the Sportwagon has its own 17-inch wheels and standard rear park assist. It features a wood and leather-trimmed steering wheel, plus a tailgate with a rear window that can open independent of the gate. Silver roof rails are standard and black roof rails are available as a no-cost option.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Sportwagon has a 227-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 and an automatic transmission. The folding backseat is split 70/30. Four luggage tie-downs are installed in the rear cargo area, which includes a luggage cover and cargo net. A hidden storage compartment includes a 12-volt power outlet and detachable side doors. A cargo net is standard.\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Jaguar’s decision to bring a wagon to market rather than a beefy, gas-guzzling SUV might have had nothing to do with the threat of rising gasoline prices.\n\nAfter all, the British automaker made the decision to go ahead with design of the all-new X-type wagon about four years ago, when gasoline prices were at least a dollar a gallon lower than they are now.\n\nAnd rarely does anyone at Jaguar think much about economy of operation when going about the business of designing a new vehicle for the company’s luxury-car lineup. After all, some of the company’s most-expensive models are notorious gas hogs.\n\nBut in light of the recent huge spikes in gasoline prices and the concerns that consumers — including many who usually don’t worry about such things — have begun to show about fuel economy, introduction of a Jaguar wagon with decent mileage ratings might be quite timely.\n\nMost automakers are now adding wagons to their lineups as consumers, weary of high fuel consumption in their big SUVs, are moving back to wagons or the so-called crossover sport utilities or “sport tourers,” which are really just puffed-up station wagons.\n\nGranted, EPA ratings of 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway aren’t quite as high as the mileage of a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, whose average ratings are in the 30s.\n\nBut a Jaguar wagon isn’t exactly a Civic or a Corolla, either. It’s a Jaguar, through and through, giving the buyer a vehicle that not only bears a legendary trademark, but that also is quite fun to drive even if it is a somewhat practical family-hauler.\n\nWith a price beginning at $36,350 (plus $665 freight), it’s not cheap. But then one could pay that much or more for a rather thirsty big SUV that isn’t even a luxury brand –such as a Ford Expedition or Chevrolet Tahoe — and still have to worry about shelling out $75 every two or three days to fill the huge gas tank.\n\nThere’s no way to get 24 mpg out of a full-size or even most midsize SUVs. The Expedition’s EPA ratings, for example, are 13 city/17 highway. The best the Ford Explorer can do, even with the V-6 engine, is 16 city/21 highway.\n\nSo unless you’re someone who just has to have the extra roominess of a big SUV, then a wagon such as the X-type, with its Jaguar-style luxury, might be a viable alternative, considering the extra costs of operating those larger vehicles.\n\nI’m not the kind of consumer who lusts after expensive luxury cars, and probably would never consider spending $70,000 or even $50,000 on a car — even one as nice as a Jaguar.\n\nBut with the bottom-line sticker price of $37,590 (including freight) on our test vehicle, the 2005 X-type wagon, I could be tempted to buy my first Jaguar.\n\nAfter just a few minutes behind the wheel, I was hooked. I have also driven the X-type sedan, and I can tell you that there is truly no difference in how the wagon handles compared with the sedan. You don’t have to give up anything in the way the sedan rides or drives to have such a practical vehicle as this wagon.\n\nFor its first wagon, Jaguar chose the platform of its compact X-type sedan, which allowed for the creation of a premium compact wagon in the same size and class as the Audi A4, Volvo V50 and Mercedes-Benz C-class wagons, among others.\n\nIntroduced earlier this year as a 2005 model and continuing this fall as an ’06 model with no changes, this vehicle is powered by the same 3.0-liter V-6 engine used in the X-type sedan.\n\nThe driving experience was very Jaguar-like even though this is the company’s lower-priced entry vehicle. It is based on the chassis of the European Ford Mondeo (which also was the basis for the now-discontinued U.S. Ford Contour and Mercury Cougar). In spite of that heritage, this car is nothing like a Mondeo, Contour or Cougar.\n\nAt a starting price in the low-$30,000s, even the X-type sedan looks and feels like a real Jaguar. The company, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., introduced the X-type sedan three years ago to give those on a budget a chance to own a Jaguar.\n\nThe rest of the Jaguar line runs from $45,000 up to nearly $90,000, so a price in the $30s is quite a bargain.\n\nThe X-type wagon costs a bit more than the base sedan, which lists for $31,495 with five-speed manual gearbox, $34,995 with automatic. But if you need a wagon and can afford the extra money, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nOf course, there is no third row of seating, so if you have more than five people to haul around, you’ll still need a minivan or an SUV that offers three seats.\n\nBut the X-type wagon does have a tall cargo area behind the back seat, and the seat can be lowered to extend the cargo compartment to the back of the front seat.\n\nJaguar has aimed this vehicle at active young couples who often have sports equipment and other such things to carry around.\n\nThe company hopes that the wagon will bring younger, less-affluent buyers into showrooms — people who later on will have more money to spend, and will then choose to spend it on more-expensive Jag models.\n\nThe wagon seems to have the same quality built into it that can be found in the more-expensive Jaguars, even if power and amenities are limited. Since being taken over by Ford in the mid-90s, Jaguar has come a long way in establishing itself as a manufacturer of quality products.\n\nThe company this year was ranked second overall in initial quality among all automakers by J.D. Power, just behind the leader, Lexus.\n\nThe company was ranked No. 1 in sales satisfaction by J.D. Power — for the second year in a row — tied with Lexus. And Jaguar was judged to have the best pre-owned sales program in the luxury car industry.\n\nAnd the X-type’s initial quality, as judged by a separate J.D. Power survey, has improved 32 percent since its fall 2001 introduction.\n\nWhile the X-type hasn’t sold as well as Jaguar had expected, the company has totaled more than 100,000 sales of the car in North America and 250,000 worldwide since introduction. That is fairly impressive considering that some Lexus, Infiniti, Mercedes and Audi vehicles in the same class haven’t done much better.\n\nOriginally, the X-type sedan came in two versions, based on engine size — either the entry-level 2.5-liter V-6 or the uplevel 3.0-liter V-6.\n\nFor 2005, though, the base engine has been dropped. Now only the 3.0-liter V-6 is offered, and that’s the one that comes in the wagon. It’s rated at 227 horsepower and 206 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nWith the standard five-speed automatic transmission, this engine can power the car from zero to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds\n\nHere’s a plus: Full-time all-wheel drive is standard on every model. All-wheel drive is hot right now, even in Sun Belt states, because it offers the best traction on all road surfaces and in all weather conditions, wet or dry.\n\nJaguar expects the wagon to account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the X-type’s total annual sales.\n\nAlthough it is styled similarly to the sedan and carries the same drivetrain, the wagon has 420 different parts and 58 new body stampings, including unique rear doors and roof. The wagon comes with a split tailgate and functional roof rails, and has a structure that is 8 percent stiffer than that of the sedan, Jaguar said.\n\nEven with the back seat in place, there is 50 cubic feet of open cargo space, as well as four cubic feet of hidden space under the cargo floor.\n\nIncluded in the carpeted cargo compartment are chrome cargo tiedowns and a 12-volt power outlet that allows for recharging of a laptop computer while it is concealed in the under-floor storage area. There is a removeable cargo-area cover as well.\n\nSafety features include standard side-curtain air bags for front and rear occupants, along with four-wheel antilock disc brakes with electronic brakeforce distribution.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Before we clocked the first mile on our test vehicle, we were favorably disposed toward the 2002 Jaguar X-type — the so-called “baby Jag.” What’s not to like about a near-luxury sedan with a brand name, a rich tradition and all-wheel drive that starts at around $30,000? But after a week behind the wheel of the X-type, we found more to fault than to praise in this new mid-size entry.\n\nHe: We drove the X-type the same week we had the new Cadillac CTS in our driveway, and you couldn’t find two more disparate designs in the near-lux segment. Where the CTS is edgy and high-tech, the X-type is more subtle and traditional, in keeping with the heritage of the British brand, which is owned by Ford. Unfortunately, our test car didn’t live up to our initial expectations.\n\nShe: Hmmm. I think your big problem is that the cabin of the X-type looks too much like a library. It triggers flashbacks of all those mean nuns at your old Catholic school. You drift back to those dark days at Macomb Community College, when you’d skip computer class to play euchre in the student center. Darn, I should have been a psychologist like my cousin Linda. By the way, what did you dream about last night?\n\nHe: Playing pinochle in the back seat of the X-type. Only it was too cramped. And not nearly as sumptuous as the bigger Jaguars. Even the wood has a low-priced look. But that wasn’t my biggest complaint. The X-type comes with your choice of two Ford V-6 engines that have been modified by Jaguar. We had the standard 2.5-liter engine, which makes 194 horsepower and on our test car was mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. In the morning, when the engine was cold, it would cough and stumble for several minutes — a situation we haven’t encountered much in recent years. What’s more, a plastic molding around the windshield vent lifted up — something you aren’t likely to see on any of the X-type’s competitors, including class leaders like the BMW 3-series and the Lexus ES 300. The LED readout below the center display had an annoying flicker, and the darn bun warmers kept shutting themselves off.\n\nShe: A real hardship when you’re playing cards, huh? But I’ll bet a lot of buyers will be drawn to the X-type because it so closely resembles the $57,000 XJ8 sedan. And there is quite a bit of value-added to the X-type. It’s the first all-wheel-drive Jaguar, which means it should easily propel you through the snow and slush. We didn’t get to test it in the dead of winter, but you drove it earlier this year in France on some slick roads and thought it was just dandy, dynamically speaking. And I am impressed with the standard safety features. You won’t pay extra for the side air bags or side air curtains, which cover the front and rear passengers. Anti-lock brakes are standard, and so is traction control. Plus, there are lots of other amenities built into that base price, including a tilt-telescoping steering wheel and an eight-way power driver’s seat.\n\nHe: The X-type really is a lovely driver. You would never guess the basic underpinnings were adapted from the Ford Mondeo, which once was sold here as the Contour. Jaguar engineers have totally revamped many of the systems and components, so the chassis is remarkably supple, the steering crisp and the ride well-behaved. I’d recommend the larger 3.0-liter engine and, if you want additional entertainment, the standard five-speed manual gearbox, although the $1,275 automatic is very civilized. I can’t say the same for the instrument panel, which seems jarringly out of place in the X-type.\n\nShe: I thought the big digital display in the center console didn’t fit the X-type’s clubby image. Plus, it wasn’t very sensibly thought out. Some of the audio and climate controls were accessed via the touch screen, while others were located elsewhere, in the form of more traditional dials and switches. I found myself taking my eyes off the road too often to fiddle with those things. Also, you get a real “leaper od ornament like you do on the more expensive Jags, but there’s a tacky Jaguar emblem in the center of the steering wheel. It reminds me of the $2 charm bracelet I bought at Tiger Stadium in 1968. It was classy at the time, but my tastes have matured.\n\nHe: This from a woman who still likes to wear fake antlers at Christmas. Sad to say, but the X-type is unevenly executed and brimming with contradictions — and in the end, doesn’t measure up to the competition. At best, it’s only average. And that’s a disappointment from a respected brand like Jaguar.\n\n2002 Jaguar X-type\n\nAnita’s rating: (Acceptable)\n\nPaul’s rating: (Acceptable)\n\nLikes: Strong visual resemblance to larger Jaguar siblings. Great all-wheel-drive tractability. Supple suspension. Crisp steering. Standard ABS, side air bags and air curtains.\n\nDislikes: Engine stumbles when cold. Not enough rear leg and head room. Huge digital display looks out of place. Confusing, complicated audio and climate controls. Plastic molding around windshield vent lifted up. Cabin not up to Jaguar’s usual standards. Flickering LED readout. Bun warmers kept shutting off. Tacky logo in steering wheel. Only one cupholder in front (Anita).\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger near-luxury sedan.\n\nPrice: Base: $31,225 (with automatic transmission); as tested, $32,420 (inc. $645 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter V-6; 194-hp; 180 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 mpg city/26 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,417 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: England",
