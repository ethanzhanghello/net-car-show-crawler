      "expert_review": "It’s easy to feel good driving down the road in a Jaguar XK. Granted, if you were having to make hefty monthly payments on it, that might take some of the pleasure away.\n\nBut Jaguar dealers say that most XK buyers are what they call “check-writers,” which means they don’t finance these cars – they just pay cash.\n\nSome customers lease these cars and write off the payments as a business expense, but it’s rare to find someone financing an XK the way most of us would a Camry, Suburban or Civic.\n\nFinancial considerations aside, though, there is nothing quite like a Jaguar, and especially the XK, whose coupe version starts at $75,500 (including freight) and convertible at $81,500.\n\nFor this report, we tested the 2007 XK coupe, with a gorgeous “frost blue” exterior color and an elegant “caramel” interior with burl walnut trim.\n\n“Gorgeous” is how Jaguar’s ad campaign describes the XK, which was completely redesigned for 2007.\n\nBoth the car and the ad campaign were designed to help pump up this British luxury car line, which already has made great strides in improving quality since it was purchased by Ford Motor Co. in 1989.\n\nAlthough Ford is now looking at the possibility of selling Jaguar and Land Rover, the British SUV maker that Ford purchased in 2000, whoever eventually takes over Jaguar will find the company to be in much better shape than it was in 1989.\n\nThe beautiful XK coupe and convertible show that Jaguar knows how to create a vehicle that can compete successfully in the top end of the auto business, where style, comfort and performance must be blended perfectly to meet the expectations of customers who are used to having the very best of everything.\n\nAs for quality, Jaguar is ranked above its European blueblood rivals, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi, and is on par with the Lexus, the best of the Japanese luxury brands.\n\nThe XK “delivers on the Jaguar vision of beautiful, fast cars,” the company said. The vehicle signified a new design direction for Jaguar, and improved on the car it replaced by offering more power, a roomier interior, and improved fuel economy.\n\n“This car is shattering misconceptions about the Jaguar brand,” marketing manager Heather Harkovich said when the car was launched in the U.S. market last year. Among those misconceptions, she said, are that Jaguar is “an older man’s car,” has “poor quality,” and is “behind in technology.”\n\nThe company’s vision for the brand, she said, “is to move from being a traditional British car to a global luxury brand that is contemporary and modern.”\n\nCustomers of Jaguar are seen as “connoisseurs of fine living,” she said. Those who buy the XK are predominately men 40 to 50, with a median income of $250,000, “people who appreciate art, fashion, travel and fine wine.”\n\nAfter a few days behind the wheel of the XK coupe, I could almost see myself living that lifestyle. The bubble burst when I got my first $300-plus electric bill of the summer, but the dream was fun while it lasted.\n\nThe car drives as great as it looks, thanks in part to the normally aspirated Jaguar 4.2-liter V-8 engine. It cranks out an impressive 300 horsepower and 310 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThis engine is connected to a six-speed sequential-shift automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddles that let the driver shift manually. The transmission has a sport mode for more aggressive automatic shifting.\n\nWith this drivetrain, the coupe can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds. Top speed is governed to 155 mph, but without the governor, the car could go a bit faster (on the track, please, not the highway).\n\nSurprisingly, the XK is quite fuel-efficient. EPA ratings (using the less-stringent pre-2008 formula) are 18 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway. Unlike some other cars in the XK’s class, the decent mileage keeps the car exempt from the U.S. gas-guzzler tax. To get that kind of mileage, though, the car could not be driven aggressively.\n\nThere is a theory that people who buy cars this expensive don’t really care about fuel economy or the price of gasoline, but that’s not true. While the average Jag owner might be able to afford expensive gasoline better than the rest of us, these consumers do appreciate saving money where they can.\n\nJaguar says the major competitors of the XK are the Lexus SC 430 at $66,000; Cadillac XLR at $77,300; BMW 650i at $81,200; and Mercedes-Benz SL500 at $93,700. But showroom surveys have found that 55 percent of XK buyers didn’t even consider another vehicle.\n\nMajor attributes of the XK that appeal to luxury-car buyers are its “beautiful styling, sporting credentials, versatility (the car’s two-plus-two seating and ample luggage space), a contemporary interior with superior craftsmanship, and Jaguar’s prestige and heritage,” Harkovich said.\n\nAs for the two-plus-two seating: There is no legroom in the back for anyone over about age 8, so this is not a car that two couples can take out to dinner. The trunk can easily handle a couple of golf bags, though, an important consideration among this class of consumers.\n\nThe interior is elegant without being the least bit gaudy, and aluminum interior trim can be substituted for the burl walnut for those who don’t care for the wood. Some younger buyers – mostly those in their 30s and 40s – don’t appreciate the traditional Jaguar wood trim the way older customers do, the company noted.\n\nTo me, though, having grown up in the ’50s and ’60s when Jaguars were among the most revered luxury cars on the market, the wood trim is synonymous with Jaguar. It’s just something I would expect to find on the dash, door panels, shift knob and so forth. Jaguar officials said there was a heated internal debate over the issur of wood or aluminum trim, so offering both was the solution. The aluminum is standard, but there is no extra cost to substitute the wood.\n\nThe new XK is “two cars in one,” said Russ Varney, the car’s chief engineer, “both a sports car and a GT.” The GT (grand touring) designation means the car is designed for long trips – something that the traditional sports car often is not suited for because of lack of cargo space, a less-than-comfortable interior, and a harsh ride.\n\nBut the XK still drives like a sports car, despite the attributes that make it practical for everyday use. Even with that practicality, the XK continues Jaguar’s mission of delivering “beautiful, fast cars,” Varney said.\n\nThe XK comes with an all-aluminum body, which Jaguar developed based on its experience with the current XJ lineup, also made of aluminum.\n\nUsing aluminum makes the XK significantly lighter than its BMW and Mercedes competitors, Varney said. The weight savings over the previous XK with a steel body is equivalent to two adults and their luggage. The lighter weight helped increase fuel economy.\n\nTechnology also is showcased in the new XK, which comes with a computerized active suspension and electronic stability control, among other things.\n\nThe car is as comfortable as a living room recliner for front passengers, and, of course, leather upholstery is standard.\n\nSafety features, besides the stability control and antilock brakes, include driver and passenger seat-mounted side air bags, along with seatbelt pretensioners.\n\nOther standard amenities include a security system; an Alpine audio system with six-disc, in-dash CD changer; bi-xenon headlights; Bluetooth hands-free telephone system; rain-sensing windshield wipers; reverse parking sensor; a DVD/GPS navigation system with a seven-inch color touch screen; keyless entry and start; automatic climate control; and a universal garage/gate opener.\n\nExtras on our test vehicle included 20-inch Senta wheels ($5,000) and a luxury package ($3,300). That gave the car a total sticker price of $83,335, including freight.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2006 about the coupe and sedan versions of the 2007 Jaguar XK. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nReengineered and restyled for 2007, the XK (formerly XK8) is a head-turner. At first sight it caught my attention, but it wasn’t love … until I drove it, in coupe and convertible forms. The XK is one of those rare cars in which all the systems work together as if made for each other — an obvious goal, yet one that’s rarely met.\n\nIn terms of gadgets, the car is comparatively low-key. There’s plenty of high-tech, but it’s out of sight, in the service of performance. Despite some cosmetic quality problems, this is Jaguar’s best effort, any way you look at it.\n\nExterior & Styling\nSome folks object to the XK’s oval-grille mouth, which makes it the latest addition to the long-standing Angry Grouper Automotive Design Movement. Personally, I guess I just like fish. Many people mistake the new model for an Aston Martin, possibly because it’s broader at its base than the previous generation, which had the floating-snake-head look of the classic Jaguar E-Type. (I’d be at a loss without Animal Planet.)\n\nAs proven by the Chrysler 300, copying another car can be a good idea — when it’s a more expensive one. Fortunately, Aston Martin has the same parent as Jaguar — Ford Motor Co. — so a lawsuit is unlikely. What makes the XK a looker, in my opinion, is its muscular haunches. In a strange regression, Jaguar mars those lines with a powered telescoping whip antenna, which is all but extinct in modern cars. On the upside, its operation is almost silent, and the whip remains the most effective antenna if you care about FM reception.\n\nThe convertible top does its business in less than 20 seconds. Though many new convertibles are going the retractable-hardtop route, the XK’s fully automatic soft-top provides a pleasing roofline, and when lowered it hides completely under a hard tonneau cover for the cleanest look.\n\nAdorning an XK couldn’t be simpler: You can’t. There are no factory options that change the exterior except paint and wheels.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe XK isn’t a small car, but in short order I was driving it like one, flinging it into curves, powering out of turns and generally enjoying its capability and poise. The rear-wheel drive coupe and convertible both have excellent front-to-rear balance, which lets all the wheels share the duty of gripping the road in spirited cornering. Jaguar cites front/rear weight distributions of 53/47 for the coupe and 52/48 for the convertible.\n\nMy test cars rode on different wheels and tires: standard 18-inch wheels with Continental SportContact 2 tires rated 245/45ZR18 and 255/48ZR18 (front and rear) on the convertible, and optional 20-inch Senta-Style wheels with Dunlop SP Sport MAXX tires rated 255/35ZR20 and 285/30ZR20 on the coupe. Both of these summer performance tires had excellent roadholding, but the tradeoff is that you’ll need all-season or winter tires if you plan on tackling snow and ice. The coupe’s low-profile tires made for slightly sharper turn-in, but the biggest difference was in ride quality: The 20s rode much firmer than the 18s, to the extent that I had to confirm the suspension tuning was the same. With standard equipment, the ride is firm but comfortable.\n\nThe car’s high level of control comes in part from its excellent accelerator response. It also helps that the body itself, now made completely of aluminum, is stiffer — specifically 31 percent and 48 percent greater in torsional rigidity for the coupe and convertible, respectively. The XK feels utterly grounded; perhaps the lighter-weight body lowers the car’s center of gravity, too.\n\nBehind the scenes, an adaptive suspension limits body roll and attempts to combine ride comfort with athletic handling. It does a very good job, automatically. I know Jaguar makes a point of limiting clutter — unlike its German rivals — but it wouldn’t hurt to add a soft/firm selector for the suspension, simply because if people pay for technology, they want to know it’s there and that they can play with it.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe aluminum construction makes the car lighter than its predecessor. Combine this with an incremental power increase from the 4.2-liter V-8, and you have quicker cars. The 300 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 310 pounds-feet of torque at 4,100 rpm propel the coupe to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds, according to Jaguar. The convertible takes 6.0 seconds. This comes with respectable gas mileage of 18/27 (city/highway), good enough to avoid a gas-guzzler tax, which can’t be said of the BMW 650i coupe or convertible.\n\nNow, when you consider that the 2006 XKR did 0-60 mph in 5.2 seconds with a 390-hp supercharged engine, the lighter, 420-hp 2007 version announced in June should break 5 seconds easily when it hits dealerships in November.\n\nThe regular XK should be more than fast enough for most drivers, and there’s more to acceleration than test times. How a drivetrain does its job is critical, and here the XK is exceptional. The six-speed transmission has automatic Drive and Sport modes, as well as paddles on the steering wheel for clutchless-manual shifting. I’ve always found this feature nearly pointless, and the paddles silly. I occasionally use them, but it’s only because automatic transmissions invariably fail at their job, which to my thinking is to be in the right gear at the right time.\n\nIt’s with this established that I say the XK’s transmission is excellent, and it has the absolute best Sport mode I’ve ever driven. First off, the upshifts and downshifts are very quick — a basic characteristic that’s taken a backseat in recent years to additional gears and technological “advances.” I’ve driven many automatics that are claimed to adapt to your driving style, but never has a transmission read my mind like the XK’s. When I wanted quick acceleration, it stayed in a lower gear exactly the right duration. When I lifted my foot quickly off the accelerator, the gearbox had downshifted by the time my sole hit the brake pedal to enter a turn. And on and on it went, always doing the right thing at the right time, quickly. Bravo, Jaguar. If all automatics operated like this, auto-manual modes would be completely pointless, and paddles even sillier.\n\nThe XK’s exhaust note is intoxicating; imagine a refined Mustang GT. It’s just audible enough in normal driving, and it becomes a roar befitting the grandest jaguar of the four-legged variety. (Jaguar must concur, as it’s using the exhaust sound in its XK advertising.)\n\nIn braking, the requisite words are all there: four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, electronic brake-force distribution, etc. More important, the performance is very good. Linearity, pedal feel and all that are decent, but the main thing is that the brakes are plain strong. The XK stops like a woman passing a shoe store. (Guys, am I right?) Again, the braking, like the handling, stands up perfectly to the engine power. Have I mentioned that I love this car?\n\nThe Inside\nLike most Jaguars, the XK’s cabin isn’t the roomiest you’ll find, but it is significantly better than the previous model in all dimensions. For comparison, the BMW 650i is larger in most dimensions, anywhere from fractions to full inches. One exception is front-seat legroom, where the XK wins by an inch, at the expense of backseat legroom.\n\nI’ll let the photos and captions tell the story of the interior, but it’s worth noting here that Jaguar keeps the controls to a minimum. Standard is a touch-screen interface for the stereo, climate controls and navigation system. The touch-screen is far better than the rotary knobs to which the German automakers stubbornly cling, but a couple things could be better: The nav map’s zoom control comprises tiny onscreen buttons. A larger, real rocker switch would be worth the dashboard space. Also, the menus, once selected, slide into the screen from the side. It’s kinda slick … once. Then you just wish it would give you the menu faster.\n\nRetractable hardtops are the rage, in part because they make for a quieter cabin. The XK’s ragtop makes no compromise, though. Its top is thick and does a great job of keeping sound out. According to my measurements, the coupe was actually 1 to 2 decibels louder, probably because of increased road noise from the optional low-profile tires. One tradeoff does remain: The soft-top makes for a broad C-pillar that obstructs the rear view.\n\nThere were some initial quality problems. Some steering-wheel trim and a handle on the trunk lid’s underside were missing. The carpet in the coupe’s cargo area had separated from the body, and when I pulled the front seat’s backrest forward, the handle snapped off in my hand. I promise I wasn’t that anxious to jam myself into the backseat, which has zero legroom when the front seats are back all the way.\n\nSafety\nAs a new model, the XK hadn’t been crash-tested as of this writing. Other safety provisions include dual-stage front airbags that vary their deployment intensity based on occupant position and crash severity, seat-mounted side-impact airbags designed to protect occupant torsos and heads, active head restraints, and roll bars that pop up if the convertible rolls. An electronic stability system is standard, though only the coupe appeared to have a button that retains the traction control but allows more sideways slippage for performance driving.\n\nForward Alert sounds a warning if the car is approaching an obstacle at too high a speed. The driver can preset the distance at which the alert activates.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe new XK coupe replaces the previous generation’s trunk with a liftgate and cargo hatch. Technically, the hatch is a bit smaller at 10.6 cubic feet, but it’s longer and more versatile, capable of storing one or two sets of golf clubs. The convertible has 7.1 cubic feet in its trunk when the top is down, but a nifty partition can be raised to increase it to 10.0 cubic feet when the top is up — a 0.8-cubic-foot decrease from the previous generation. Run-flat tires supersede the spare tire. To compare, the 650i coupe has a 13.0-cubic-foot trunk; the convertible has 10.6 cubic feet of cargo space with the top down and 12.4 when it’s up. The XK is not rated for towing.\n\nFeatures\nThe buttons above lead to all the standard and optional feature information. A few extra quibbles: The XK has front-mounted radar that provides the Forward Alert and active cruise control, which maintains a selectable distance from the car ahead and slows the car if necessary. This system doesn’t stop the car completely; it alerts the driver when a low speed threshold is reached. In my test vehicles, the feature didn’t do the best job of distinguishing between cars ahead in adjacent lanes and those in my lane. It made for a lot of unnecessary slowing and going. I was unmoved by the Alpine premium stereo. Some less expensive cars’ systems are much better.\n\nAnother novel feature is Automatic Speed Limiter, activated via a button on the center console. Setting a speed with the cruise control and pressing the button prevents the car from exceeding the speed. I’ve seen features that alert drivers when they exceed a preset speed, but never one that’s an actual speed limiter. Not the worst solution I’ve seen for leadfooted drivers.\n\nXK in the Market\nI’m an ardent fan of the BMW 6 Series — the first of the new BMW designs that truly works. I’d take a real manual over an automatic — even the XK’s — any day, and here the 650i has an advantage. If you’re not a speed freak, the new XK is stiff competition for the BMW in every way, though we have yet to see if the quality issues disappear. It takes a lot to get me going, and the XK lights my fire more than the 6 Series does. If anything, the Ultimate Driving Machines have been losing some of their soul over the past few years. Jaguar seems to be getting its soul back.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Every now and then you read a story about someone who says their life was ruined by winning some super-mega-ball lottery. It’s hard to imagine, especially when you could find literally millions of people willing to take their place.\n\nI think I know what the problem is for these downtrodden winners: They didn’t use some of their loot to buy a Jaguar XK convertible. With head-turning looks, refined V-8 power and a plush interior, this car can only make your life better.\n\nThe Look\nThere’s a timeless elegance to the XK convertible that’s appealing. With its low-slung shape, the XK is the road-going equivalent of a cruise missile. Modest exterior changes for 2010 include a restyled front bumper with grates in front of the wheels. For more details on how the XK convertible has changed from 2009, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhat really makes the XK’s look is its sleek rear quarter. Too many new convertibles have bloated trunklids meant to accommodate a lowered roof, but the XK continues the flowing lines set forth by the car’s front-end styling. Bravo.\n\nThis Cat Can Run\nThe XK gets a new V-8 engine for 2010 — not that it needed one. The 4.2-liter V-8 in the 2009 model didn’t leave you wanting for power, and the new 5.0-liter V-8 feels very quick, too. Jaguar says the convertible can leap from zero to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds.\n\nBefitting the XK’s grand touring disposition, its 385-horsepower engine offers effortless performance. You get the sense that it has plenty of power in reserve if you need it, and when you do need it, the XK delivers without missing a step. This car makes you want to forget about going to work and drive across the country instead.\n\nJust as addictive as the V-8’s wave of power — which is available at any legal speed — is the sound that emanates from the twin chrome exhaust tips poking out from beneath the bumper. You can always hear the V-8’s deep voice echoing from the pipes — even when just cruising around town — but it’s such a wonderful sound you might find yourself turning down the radio to hear it better. When you stand on the gas, the exhaust note comes out as a sharp bark. It’s different, but it’s equally melodious.\n\nThe XK has a standard six-speed automatic transmission that’s well matched to the V-8. It shifts smoothly during leisurely cruising, but it readily kicks down with just a prod of the gas pedal when you need more power to make a quick move on the highway.\n\nIf you’d rather control gear changes yourself, there are paddle shifters on the back of the steering wheel. You can take over for the transmission when the XK is in Drive by pressing one of the paddles, and it will remain in clutchless-manual mode for a short time before reverting back to automatic operation. If you want continuous control, you need to move the console gear selector to Sport.\n\nThe XK’s manual-mode response is quicker than most; there’s not much delay between pulling one of the paddles and shifting. While sluggish shift response is a common downfall of these systems, the XK’s is quick enough to be entertaining.\n\nSurprising Blend of Handling & Ride Comfort\nThe XK is a big sports car, but it handles like a much smaller one. It’s surprisingly nimble and athletic when cornering, so there’s something there both for enthusiast buyers and for those looking for a comfortable luxury two-door.\n\nThe XK’s standard adaptive suspension lets you feel the road but offers enough damping to keep the ride from becoming rough. Even with the suspension in normal mode, you can attack corners with confidence, but the XK’s Dynamic Mode is specifically designed for such things. Compared with regular mode, Dynamic Mode firms up the suspension, increases the sensitivity of the gas pedal and makes the transmission’s shifts faster. You have a greater feel for the road in Dynamic Mode, but you get an improvement in cornering prowess, too. The XK also includes a Winter Mode designed to improve performance on slippery surfaces by making shifts smoother and calibrating the gas pedal to provide more gradual acceleration.\n\nWhile the XK’s handling qualities are nice, they’re probably not the main reason people buy this convertible. It’s primarily designed to be a comfortable touring car, and it succeeds thanks to its compliant ride and comfortable driving position.\n\nConvertible Commentary\nOne of the things that impressed me about the XK convertible was how quiet the cabin is when the top is up and how little wind buffeting you feel with the top down.\n\nWhile you do get some road noise in the cabin when driving on concrete highways, the cockpit is very hushed on asphalt surfaces at highway speeds, with just a hint of wind noise. It’s quiet enough to easily hold a conversation without having to raise your voice. The C-pillar formed by the soft-top, however, blocks quite a bit of your view when checking your right-side blind spot.\n\nLowering the power-operated top is a cinch; push a button above the rearview mirror and it automatically retracts and stows into the top of the trunk. With the top down, you can definitely feel air swirling around you on the highway, but it’s more like a light breeze than a wind tunnel. The XK convertible comes with a windscreen that you can set up behind the front seats, but it makes the two-person backseat unusable (not that it was very usable before).\n\nWhere some convertibles have poor structural rigidity, the XK benefits from all-aluminum construction, and the car feels solid even on rougher roads. I felt a slight chassis shudder on some worn roads, but it’s not significant enough to detract from the experience of cruising with the top down on a warm summer day.\n\nCabin Hits & Misses\nThe most noticeable change to the 2010 XK’s cabin is its new console gear selector, which is similar to the one in the XF sport sedan. Instead of a traditional gated shifter, the XK uses a knob. The knob retracts until it’s flush with the center console when the car is turned off, then rises from its hole when the engine is started. The new design has a clean appearance and the knob is easy to operate, but some Jaguar fans may bemoan the loss of the J-gate shifter.\n\nJaguar made some smart decisions in the cabin, but there are a handful of questionable ones, too. While most of what you’ll touch — the steering wheel, leather bucket seats and door-mounted seat controls — has a level of luxury appropriate for a car that starts at more than $88,000, some items don’t measure up. Take the silver-colored air-conditioning controls and buttons behind the gear selector. They could be straight out of a run-of-the-mill family sedan. It’s even more surprising when you consider the highly detailed chrome controls for the power seats, which would pass muster in a Bentley. Also, the Volvo-style power-mirror controls are an example of parts-sharing gone awry. (Both brands were owned by Ford during the XK’s development.)\n\nThe cabin has a minimalist look, partly because of the few physical buttons on the center control panel. This is possible because many of the car’s systems — including the standard navigation feature — are operated by a touch-screen display. The interface is easy enough to learn, but the electronics need more processing power; switching between feature menus, like air conditioning and the radio, takes longer than it should — and longer than it does in other cars.\n\nThe XK’s two-person backseat is amusing — as long as you don’t have to sit back there. Very few people would be able to fit comfortably due to its nearly nonexistent legroom. The XK isn’t a car in which you’d want to bring the kids along for the ride — or one you’d want to use for a double date. It’s designed for the driver — and perhaps a passenger — but no one else.\n\nThe inclusion of a backseat, though, prevents taller drivers from adjusting their seat exactly how they want. I stand about 6-foot-1 and like to sit a good distance from the pedals. As I was moving the seat backward, the backrest began to angle forward automatically the farther back I went. I imagine that’s to protect the seat and its electric motors from straining against the backseat cushion, but if that seat weren’t there in the first place, there’d be more room for the front buckets.\n\nCargo\nEven though the backseat is no good for carrying people, you can use it to stow luggage. That’s a good thing, because the trunk, at 7.1 cubic feet with the top down, isn’t very big. A partition in the trunk can be moved out of the way to make the space taller if you know you’re not going to lower the top, and that increases volume to 11.1 cubic feet. When the partition is there, there’s only enough room for a few small items under it and one or two soft bags behind it. The XK’s cargo volume puts it closer to the Mercedes-Benz SL550 retractable hardtop (10.2 cubic feet with the top up, 7.2 with it down) than the BMW 650i soft-top (12.4 up, 10.6 down).\n\nSafety\nStandard XK convertible safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, an electronic stability system and active front head restraints designed to prevent whiplash injuries. When equipped with optional adaptive cruise control, the XK can warn the driver of an impending collision and build pressure in the brake lines to enhance stopping performance when the driver presses the pedal. For additional safety information, check the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nXK in the Market\nThe XK and cars like it — including the Mercedes-Benz SL550 and BMW 650i convertible — have very specific purposes that can be summed up in a few words: Get me where I need to go in comfort and style. Based on these criteria, the XK is a resounding success, and its quick acceleration and surprising athleticism even offer something for driving enthusiasts. Now, does anyone have any secrets for picking winning lottery numbers?\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "All right, I admit it – I like looking at myself driving in the reflections of buildings, and get absolutely giddy when I’m behind the wheel of something flashy. It’s the sort of vanity guys at the gym indulge in, watching themselves do arm curls in T-shirts two sizes too small. “Yeah, that’s right, this is all mine,” they’re thinking. “You, babe, are gonna have to work for this.”\nWhen I met my girlfriend four years ago, she didn’t exert much effort claiming what little upper body tone I had – and still have. She also didn’t meet me in a Jaguar XK, the graceful, debonair English coupe thoroughly laced with male pheromones. It’s the $81,000 automotive equivalent of that refreshed, endorphin-packed feeling body builders get after dropping a pair of dumbbells. They like how they feel. They know other people are watching them.\nYou’ll feel compelled, then, to trace the chrome trim outlining the pillarless side glass all the way to the coupe’s bulging rear fenders. Hot looks prompt stares and touches, even if most of the XK’s devoted audience – like the UPS driver opening his truck door to flash a thumbs-up, or the 8-year-old boy in the back of a Volkswagen craning his neck to get a glimpse – aren’t women.\nWhich comes as a bit of relief, because if all that attracted women was brute strength and a steroidal body, I’d be single for eternity. And there’s a lot more to love about the XK besides its chiseled shape, 19-inch spokes, and that muscled, muted burble from the 4.2 liter V-8.\nOnce you’re used to the big blind spots – a sacrifice for being blessed with dapper looks – the XK settles into traffic with ease. The accelerator and brake pedals allow enough travel for smooth getaways and stops without lurching or bucking, yet summon full force the instant it’s required. Steering is finely weighted at all speeds and never incites twitchiness, as can be the case with high-strung sports cars. The 6-speed automatic is just as satisfyingly quick as it revs to redline in manual mode as it is trolling at 1,500 r.p.m. on the main drag.\n Body roll is almost unnoticeable thanks to CATS (Computer Active Technology Suspension) which firms up the dampers at the hard flick of the padded, three-spoke wheel. On the highway, the shocks ease up considerably, but don’t float. This is a proper Gran Turismo: a fast 2+2 coupe that makes short work of several hundred miles. My trip to central Connecticut and back could have been to Florida instead, and even then the only required stops would be for refueling and restrooms.\nBeing surrounded by the traditional Jaguar leather-and-wood combo also makes long distances a breeze, and a power telescoping/tilt wheel and the supportive 10-way seats (with power side bolsters) ensure that drivers above 6 feet won’t have trouble getting comfortable. The “back seat” is good only for storage.\nCertainly there are faster, more powerful cars. The similarly priced BMW 650i automatic rushes to 60 in 5.4 seconds, a half-notch quicker. Ditto for the Maserati GranTurismo and Mercedes SL550. The Jag’s 300 horsepower isn’t an impressive figure in this class (the upcoming 510 horsepower XKR, 90 more than the current supercharged model, will fix that). But all of these two-doors are heavier than the all-aluminum 3,671-pound XK (3,814, 4,140, and 4,220 pounds respectively).\nOn the road, the extra half-second isn’t really a bother. As the speed builds, the XK reveals its smooth character, whether at 40 miles per hour or 100. If you must go faster and look more outrageous doing so, the Italians have plenty to choose from. But to get your V-8 fix in such style and no sweat – few cars come close.\nThere are a few unsettling details. Some cheap-feeling matte black plastic covers some of the interior door handles and instrument cluster, as in the XF sedan and Land Rovers (the rest of the switchgear has a fine tactile feel). The steering wheel and seat heater controls are buried in the infotainment display instead of as actual buttons. The exhaust is almost too soft – I’d prefer a little more snarl – but this is a gentleman’s coupe, and there’s always the XKR.\nBuyers won’t care about the 15-mile-per-gallon fuel economy or the tight back hatch. A Jaguar – especially a modern-day coupe with an E-type bloodline – is about emotion and plain old physical attraction. With the company ranked at the top of a J.D. Power reliability study, a Jaguar is no longer about regular, unscheduled trips to the garage.\nIt doesn’t matter if XK owners have flabby guts they’ve ignored for decades. This car is all theirs.",

      "expert_review": "Being a parent is a tough job. You have to be a skilled multitasker and mediator who’s armed with tons of disciplinary and diversionary tactics, and of course, you have to be able to do it all while driving. If you can afford to do it all while driving the 2011 Jaguar XK convertible, more power to you. \n\nI drove the Jaguar XK convertible with my family in tow for a full week. My 8- and 10-year-old daughters fit the limited age/size range to be able to ride in the XK convertible’s backseat, which is so small that it’s better to think of it as an additional cargo area. My girls are old enough that they no longer have to ride in booster seats (Colorado law says kids must stay in boosters until age 8), and they’re still small enough to scrunch into the convertible’s Thumbelina-sized rear seats. They quite liked the “just-their-size” rear bucket seats when the top was down, but with the top up, the complaints of feeling crowded started to flood in. It’s probably best to keep the XK in the heated garage until the kids go to Grandma’s for the weekend. When the kids are away, the parents must play!\n\nAfter driving a slew of cars with overly harsh suspensions to make them seem sportier or overly cush rides in an attempt to appear more luxurious, the rear-wheel-drive convertible’s suspension hit the sweet spot in the middle for me. It was responsive and offered enough road feedback for me to feel connected to the pleasure of the sport of driving while still being smooth enough to enjoy a mundane drive to the grocery store.\n\nWith EPA fuel economy estimates at 16/22 mpg city/highway, a premium fuel requirement and a premium price tag to boot — my base model test car cost $89,000 — you may need to hit Grandpa up for more than just weekend baby-sitting in order to add this gem to your family fleet.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nWith Denver’s crazy weather, I only got one full day of weather cooperation to test out the XK convertible in topless mode. The power soft-top opens with the press of a button on the overhead console. In no time I was on the road, enjoying the wind in my hair. With the soft-top up, wind noise is definitely noticeable; for nearly $90K, I wish Jaguar would offer a quieter hardtop version of this convertible.\n\nThe XK convertible’s two doors opened easily for both my kiddos and me. My girls easily maneuvered into the backseat by lifting a lever on the front passenger seat that folded it forward and out of the way, making room for their little legs to climb in.\n\nThe four-seater has sleek, classic Jaguar lines that look equally feminine and powerful to me.  Of course, driving though the carpool lane in anything this fancy, especially with the top down, is guaranteed to warrant plenty of oohs and aahs. More important than impressing the elementary school sect is keeping Mama happy, and the XK convertible made me feel like I looked hot driving it, even when reality may not equal fantasy. \n\nThe XK convertible I drove featured a 385-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 engine with a six-speed automatic transmission. If that’s not enough horsepower, the top-of-the-line XKR convertible has a 510-hp V-8. \n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really (but who cares?) \nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe first thing I noticed when jumping into the XK convertible for the first time is the low-profile turn-dial gearshift. I love this clean, simple design. How often do you use a gearshift during a drive anyway — once to put it in Reverse, once in Drive and once in Park? This design makes it unobtrusive and keeps it out of the way. Of course, if you want to play around with the convertible’s sportiness you can use the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.\n\nThe XK convertible pampers both the driver and front passenger with seats that adjust in a nearly infinite number of ways, including the hug-like adjustable bolsters, and heated and cooled leather seats. The power tilt/telescoping steering wheel features both audio and cruise controls that use a spring-loaded toggle switch. This makes it easy and satisfying tactilely to quickly adjust the stereo system’s volume or set the cruise control with a single touch. The steering wheel is heated to take the chill out of those brisk mornings or cool late nights when you’re driving around with the top down.\n\nThe rear seats offer nearly no legroom (depending upon the height of the driver and front passenger) and are deeply bucketed, rendering them useless for children requiring child-safety seats of any kind and those who have grown out of their tadpole stage into gangly legged pre-teens.\n\nUp front, two cupholders, shallow in-door pockets and a small center console (with integrated iPod connector) forced me to streamline the amount of stuff I bring into a car, which was a big bonus in my book. \n\nHowever, the thing that continues to boggle my mind about the XK convertible is the touch-screen controls for the heat as well as the audio and navigation systems in the XK convertible. The menus aren’t well-organized. For instance, to turn off the heat, I had to first enter the climate portion of the screen and then hunt for the power button rather than just turning the air flow down to Off. Every press of the screen took a second or two longer to load than it should, which increased my annoyance level.\n\nThe trunk space in the XK convertible has enough room to stash a couple of backpacks or a few bags of groceries, but only when the top is up. When the top is folded, the trunk has enough space to fit — well, the folded top.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny \nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair \n\nSAFETY\n\nWhile my daughters fit in the XK convertible’s tiny backseat, a lot of families, especially those on the taller side, will find they don’t.\n\nIn the backseat, my children and I were extremely grateful for the easy-to-use seat belts buckles that don’t flop around. I can’t imagine ducking under the roofline and twisting behind the front seat to help them buckle up every time. \n\nOn the flip side, the two sets of lower Latch anchors in the backseat were inaccessible. In theory, they’d be easy to use with a slit in the seats that offers access to the anchors. The reality of my test car was another story altogether. The slit was there, but a layer of cloth webbing covered the Latch anchors. I spoke with a Jaguar representative about the Latch anchors and was told to simply push my fingers through the webbing to open up access. Seriously? \n\nEven if you were to cut open the access to the Latch anchors, you wouldn’t be able to fit a car seat in the backseat. The highly contoured bucket seats aren’t a good fit for child-safety seats.\n\nThe XK convertible offers all the safety features you’d expect, including front- and side-impact airbags with head protection for the front-seat passengers (but none for the rear passengers, boo!), a pop-up roll bar in the convertible, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control, front and rear parking sensors, rear-wheel drive, daytime running lights and active head restraints in the front seats. \n\nAn Advanced Technology Package offers optional safety equipment such as adaptive headlights and adaptive cruise control for $2,625.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Jaguar XK convertible here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Jaguar XK is a high-end luxury sports car that drives as well as it looks. The four-seat XK comes as a coupe or convertible with V-8 power. There are two high-performance variants of the XK: the XKR and XKR-S. Both have supercharged V-8s, and the XKR-S’ engine puts out 550 horsepower. According to Jaguar, the XKR-S can go from zero to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. Competitors include the BMW 650i and Mercedes-Benz SL.\n\n(Skip to details on the: XKR and XKR-S)\n\nNew for 2012\nThe XK coupe and convertible receive new front and rear styling.\n\nExterior\nThe XK’s oval grille opening is different from other Jaguar models, and the broader front bumper distinguishes it from the preceding generation, called the XK8. Exterior features include:\n\n19- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nPower-operated heated side mirrors with automatic dimming\nBi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nDual exhaust\n\nInterior\nThe XK’s interior isn’t the roomiest in its class, though its front-seat legroom is far better than average and its dimensions are more than workable for adults. The backseat exists only in name; there’s no legroom unless the front occupants slide forward, and the seat cushions have oddly shaped contours. It’s “2+2” seating, which means Jaguar doesn’t expect you to think they’re real rear seats. The convertible’s soft-top is thick enough that interior noise levels aren’t much different from the coupe’s. Interior features include:\n\nLeather seats and steering wheel\nAvailable real wood or aluminum trim\nNavigation system\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nOptional adaptive cruise control\nOptional leather-appointed dash\nOptional heated steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\nJaguar claims zero to 60 mph acceleration of 5.2 seconds in the XK. Mechanical features include:\n\n385-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 (XK)\nSix-speed automatic transmission with manual shift function\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nSide-impact airbags\nActive front head restraints\nDaytime running lights\nAntilock brakes and traction control\nElectronic stability system\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nXKR\nJaguar’s XKR builds upon the XK with a 510-hp, supercharged version of the 5.0-liter V-8. A modified suspension firms up the ride but sharpens handling. Other changes include a modified exterior with a mesh grille, modified fog lights, larger wheels, quad exhaust and dual hood louvers. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard, and Jaguar says the XKR accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds. Back to top\n\nXKR-S\nJaguar claims the limited-production XKR-S has a top speed of 186 mph and will leap from zero to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. Thanks to exhaust system and engine computer tuning, the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 makes 550 hp and 502 pounds-feet of torque. Boost pressure and engine compression are also slightly higher. The engine teams with a six-speed automatic that incorporates shift paddles. The suspension is 10 millimeters lower, and the XKR-S has an electronic differential.\n\nThe exterior is different than other XKs. Gloss-black accents are present, and the front bumper incorporates a carbon fiber splitter. The aggressive-looking hood features two horizontal cooling slots near the car’s nose. At the rear, there’s a big fixed spoiler with carbon fiber inlay. The XKR-S also has unique wider side sills and a distinctive rear apron with a carbon fiber diffuser.\n\nInside, there are 16-way power-adjustable performance seats with sculpted side bolsters. RS logos adorn the head restraints and doorsills. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Jaguar XK is a high-end luxury sports car that drives as well as it looks. The four-seat XK comes as a coupe or convertible with V-8 power. There are two high-performance variants of the XK: the XKR and XKR-S. Both have supercharged V-8s, and the XKR-S’ engine puts out 550 horsepower. According to Jaguar, the XKR-S can go from zero to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. Competitors include the BMW 650i and Mercedes-Benz SL.\n(Skip to details on the: XKR, XKR-S)\nNew for 2013\nNew Touring versions of the coupe and convertible body styles give the XK a lower starting price for 2013. There’s also a new Portfolio Package for the XK and XKR that includes chrome mirror caps and a chrome grille, contrast cabin stitching, soft-grain leather, heated and cooled front seats, walnut or aluminum interior trim, a leather headliner, stainless-steel pedals and scuff plates, and leather-trimmed floormats.\nExterior\nThe XK’s oval grille opening is different from other Jaguar models, and the broader front bumper distinguishes it from the preceding generation, called the XK8. Exterior features include:\n\n\n19- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nPower-folding side mirrors with automatic dimming\nBi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nDual exhaust\nPower-folding soft-top (convertible)\n\nInterior\nThe XK’s interior isn’t the roomiest in its class, though its front-seat legroom is far better than average and its dimensions are more than workable for adults. The backseat exists only in name; there’s no legroom unless the front occupants slide forward, and the seat cushions have oddly shaped contours. It’s “2+2” seating, which means Jaguar doesn’t expect you to think they’re real rear seats. The convertible’s soft-top is thick enough that interior noise levels aren’t much different from the coupe’s. Interior features include:\n\n\nLeather seats and steering wheel\nAvailable real wood or aluminum trim\nNavigation system\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nAvailable adaptive cruise control\nAvailable leather-appointed dash\nAvailable heated steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\nJaguar claims zero to 60 mph acceleration of 5.2 seconds in the XK. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n385-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 (XK)\nSix-speed automatic transmission with manual shift function\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nActive front head restraints\nDaytime running lights\nAntilock brakes and traction control\nElectronic stability system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAvailable collision warning system\n\nXKR\nJaguar’s XKR builds upon the XK with a 510-hp, supercharged version of the 5.0-liter V-8. A modified suspension firms up the ride and sharpens handling. Other changes include a modified exterior with a mesh grille, modified fog lights, larger wheels, quad exhaust and dual hood louvers. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard, and Jaguar says the XKR accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds. Back to top\n\nXKR-S\nJaguar says the limited-production XKR-S has a top speed of 186 mph and will leap from zero to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. Thanks to exhaust system and engine computer tuning, the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 makes 550 hp and 502 pounds-feet of torque. Boost pressure and engine compression are also slightly higher. The engine teams with a six-speed automatic that incorporates shift paddles. The suspension is 10 millimeters lower, and the XKR-S has an electronic differential.\n\nThe exterior is different than other XKs. Gloss-black accents are present, and the front bumper incorporates a carbon fiber splitter. The aggressive-looking hood features two horizontal cooling slots near the car’s nose. At the rear, there’s a fixed spoiler with carbon fiber inlay. The XKR-S also has unique wider side sills and a distinctive rear apron with a carbon fiber diffuser.\n\nInside, there are 16-way power-adjustable performance seats with sculpted side bolsters. RS logos adorn the head restraints and doorsills. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Jaguar XK is a high-end luxury sports car that drives as well as it looks. The four-seat XK comes as a coupe or convertible with V-8 power. There are two high-performance variants of the XK: the XKR and XKR-S. Both have supercharged V-8s, and the XKR-S’ engine puts out 550 horsepower. According to Jaguar, the XKR-S can go from zero to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. Competitors include the BMW 650i and Mercedes-Benz SL. For 2014, there’s a limited-edition, high performance XKR-S GT coupe.  A total of 25 cars will be sold in the U.S. and five in Canada.\n(Skip to details on the: XKR, XKR-S)\nNew for 2014\nThe XKR-S GT coupe is available in limited numbers for 2014 with aerodynamic enhancements, suspension modifications and carbon ceramic brakes. A new Performance Pack is available for XKR models, which includes an active exhaust, red brake calipers and diamond-pattern stitching on the seats.\nExterior Highlights\n\n19- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nPower-folding side mirrors with automatic dimming\nBi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nDual exhaust\nPower-folding soft-top (convertible)\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nLeather seats and steering wheel\nAvailable real wood or aluminum trim\nNavigation system\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nAvailable adaptive cruise control\nAvailable leather-appointed dash\nAvailable heated steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nStandard 385-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine (XK)\nAvailable 510-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 (XKR)\nAvailable 550-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 (XKR-S)\nSix-speed automatic transmission with manual shift function\nRear-wheel drive\n\nSafety Features\n\nSide-impact airbags\nActive front head restraints\nDaytime running lights\nAntilock brakes and traction control\nElectronic stability system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAvailable collision warning system\n\nXKR\nJaguar’s XKR builds upon the XK with a 510-hp, supercharged version of the 5.0-liter V-8. A modified suspension firms up the ride and sharpens handling. Other changes include a modified exterior with a mesh grille, modified fog lights, larger wheels, quad exhaust and dual hood louvers. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard, and Jaguar says the XKR accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds. For 2014, an optional Performance Pack includes an active exhaust, red brake calipers and diamond-pattern stitching on the seats.\n\n\nBack to top\n\nXKR-S\nJaguar says the limited-production XKR-S has a top speed of 186 mph and will leap from zero to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds.\n\nFor 2014, there’s a limited-edition, high-performance XKR-S GT coupe.  A total of 25 cars will be sold in the U.S. and five in Canada. The XKR-S GT coupe features aerodynamic and suspension modifications, as well as carbon ceramic brakes.\n\nThanks to exhaust system and engine computer tuning, the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 makes 550 hp and 502 pounds-feet of torque. Boost pressure and engine compression are also slightly higher. The engine teams with a six-speed automatic that incorporates shift paddles. The suspension is 10 millimeters lower, and the XKR-S has an electronic differential.\n\nThe exterior is different than other XKs. Gloss-black accents are present, and the front bumper incorporates a carbon fiber splitter. The aggressive-looking hood features two horizontal cooling slots near the car’s nose. At the rear, there’s a fixed spoiler with carbon fiber inlay. The XKR-S also has unique wider side sills and a distinctive rear apron with a carbon fiber diffuser.\n\nInside, there are 16-way power-adjustable performance seats with sculpted side bolsters. RS logos adorn the head restraints and doorsills.\n\nBack to top",
