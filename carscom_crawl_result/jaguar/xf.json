      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Jaguar XF?\n\nThe 2024 Jaguar XF is a rear- or all-wheel-drive mid-size luxury sedan that competes against the likes of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6, Genesis G80, Cadillac CT5 and BMW 5 Series. Thanks to its sharp steering reflexes and balanced ride, the XF is quite entertaining to drive on twisty roads. Two turbocharged four-cylinder engines are available; the base P250 variant delivers 246 horsepower, while the step-up P300 version makes 296 hp. The P250 comes with RWD or AWD, while the P300 is AWD-only. Regardless of engine, the XF’s cabin is roomy, and a user-friendly 11.4-inch infotainment screen is standard.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Jaguar XF?\n\nThe XF model lineup has been pared down to include only sport-tuned R-Dynamic trims; other XF variants have been discontinued, and the XF itself will be discontinued after the 2024 model year. The Black Exterior Pack with sporty trim is now standard, as are a heated steering wheel, additional power sockets and a power-adjustable steering column.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Jaguar XF Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch Pivi Pro infotainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\n12-speaker Meridian stereo\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-adjustable steering column\nAmbient LED interior lighting\nPanoramic moonroof\nSurround-view parking camera system\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n19-inch wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nUpgraded leather seating surfaces\nMassaging front seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nPower-operated rear sunshade\nSuede headliner\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive suspension\n20-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Jaguar XF?\n\nThe Jaguar XF is a delight to drive thanks to its agile handling and nicely tuned suspension. It’s also something of a bargain, with a starting price that’s lower than some direct rivals’. The XF’s turbocharged four-cylinders are peppy and return decent fuel economy, but they lack the raw performance of key rivals. And while the cabin is roomy and thoughtfully designed, it looks its age compared with newer competitors; the XF’s basic design dates back to the 2016 model year.",

      "expert_review": "Jaguar’s XF is a great-looking car whose styling swivels heads wherever it goes.\n\nThe XF has an aggressive nose, wide-eyed headlights and a coupelike roofline. The front fender vent and the shape of the tail mimic details found on the XK coupe.\n\nThe downside to its sweet look, however, is that the design is more Lexus than Jaguar and it lacks a connection to the previous S-Type Jaguar that it replaces, aside from the familiar logos. Expect the upcoming redesign of the XJ to capture styling cues from this car.\n\nSo what’s the problem with that? Not much, except diehard Jaguar fans may wish for more of a familial connection.\n\nThe low roof does not inhibit interior space because the car’s waistline rises to meet the roof rather than the roof coming down to meet the waist. The rising waist-line results in a high tail that yields good aerodynamics while allowing substantial luggage space. The coefficient of drag is 0.29.\n\nThe XF is powered by a 4.2-liter V-8 that provides 300 horsepower in normally aspirated form and 420 horsepower when supercharged. Jaguar said the normally aspirated XF will accelerate to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds while the supercharged version will do so in 5.4 seconds.\n\nPrices begin at $49,200 for the Luxury model, $55,300 for the Premium Luxury model and $63,700 for the supercharged version. The test car was a supercharged model from Jaguar’s press fleet.\n\nIn June, Tata Motors, India’s largest automobile company, purchased Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co. J.D. Power and Associates report that Jaguar moved from 10th place in 2008 to a tie for first place in the 2009 Vehicle Dependability Study.\n\nWhile the supercharged engine is fun when you tromp on the throttle, most buyers will be more than happy with the regular engine and the corresponding lower price. Fuel economy for the non-supercharged engine is rated at 16 mpg in the city and 25 on the highway. Mileage of the supercharged model is 15 in the city and 23 on the highway.\n\nThe XF sports a number of technological features. A main one is a shift-by-wire automatic transmission that uses a console-mounted dial selector instead of a shift lever. The dial is not only simple and intuitive, but it also consumes less space than a shift lever, and I found it very natural to use.\n\nThe transmission can be shifted with paddles on the steering wheel, and because shifts are controlled electronically, they occur faster than they would if made by a manual linkage. The transmission has winter and dynamic settings that interact with the sensitivity of the throttle, shift points and vehicle stability control.\n\nThe XF, even with the 20-inch wheels on the high-performance model, has a smooth ride and responsive handling.\n\nThe cabin of the supercharged model had brushed aluminum trim and small sections of real wood. The air vents pivot closed when the engine is off and open when the car is started. That’s a nifty idea, but hardly necessary because the vents are almost always open.\n\nI was not fond of Jaguar’s touch-screen controls for audio and navigation because the menus are not as intuitive as the menus in some competing systems.\n\nThe audio system has eight speakers. Bowers & Wilkins designed the optional audio system. Jaguar plans to offer digital audio broadcasting and Sirius satellite radio along with Bluetooth connectivity for telephones. MP3 players can also be used with the audio system and can be controlled through the audio system’s touch screen.\n\nOther available features include voice control for navigation and telephone functions, a blind spot monitor, front and rear parking aids, a rear parking camera, adaptive cruise control, electronic parking brake and automatic speed limiter.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $63,700. The sticker price was $64,010.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\n2009 Jaguar XF Supercharged\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter, 420-hp V-8\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 114.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,017 lbs.\n\nBase price: $63,700\n\nAs driven: $64,010\n\nMPG rating: 15 city, 23 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jaguar XF?\n\nThe 2023 Jaguar XF is a mid-size luxury sedan that competes against the likes of the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus ES and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Thanks to its sharp steering reflexes and balanced ride, the XF is quite entertaining to drive on twisty roads. Two turbocharged four-cylinder engines are available: The base P250 variant delivers 246 horsepower, while the step-up P300 version makes 296 hp. The P250 comes with rear- or all-wheel drive, while the P300 is all-wheel-drive only. Regardless of engine, the XF’s cabin is roomy, and a user-friendly 11.4-inch infotainment screen is standard. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jaguar XF? \n\nThe only notable change is that adaptive cruise control is now standard equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jaguar XF Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch Pivi Pro infotainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\n12-speaker Meridian stereo\nAmbient LED interior lighting\nPanoramic sunroof\nSurround-view parking camera\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nUpgraded leather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nPower-operated rear sunshade\nSoft-close doors\nHead-up instrument display\n19-inch alloy wheels\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jaguar XF?\n\nThe Jaguar XF is a delight to drive thanks to its agile handling and nicely tuned suspension. It’s also something of a bargain in that its starting price is lower than a number of direct rivals. The XF’s turbocharged four-cylinders are peppy and return decent fuel economy, though the lack of a higher-performance version dents some of the car’s appeal. And while the cabin is roomy and thoughtfully designed, there’s no doubt the interior is starting to look its age compared with newer competitors (the XF’s basic design dates back to the 2016 model year).",

      "expert_review": "Comptes with: Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS, Mercedes-Benz E-Class\n\nLooks like: It got tiny, difficult-to-detect nips and tucks outside, but more noticeable changes inside\n\nPowertrain: Two turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinders, one making 246 horsepower and the other 296 hp; eight-speed automatic transmission; rear- or all-wheel drive \n\nHits dealerships: January 2021\n\nJaguar’s XF sedan gets a mild exterior styling update, more upscale cabin materials and a new multimedia system with over-the-air update functionality. There’re also a few things missing on the 2021 XF: The supercharged V-6 engine is gone, as is the Sportbrake wagon variant.\n\nRelated: 2019 Jaguar XF Sportbrake Review: Enthusiasts Might Not Rejoice\n\nExterior \n\nUpdates outside are minor and build off the sedan’s already taut, sprung look. Highlights include slimmer headlights and taillights as well as a new mesh pattern for the grille. The Sportbrake wagon that joined the lineup for model-year 2018 is no longer available for the U.S. market.\n\nInterior \n\nThe biggest updates inside are on the technology front. The 2021 XF uses Jaguar’s new Pivi Pro multimedia system with a curved glass 11.4-inch touchscreen. (It’s also used in the updated 2021 Jaguar F-Pace.)\n\nJaguar says the new system will be easy to use thanks to a simplified menu structure; the automaker has also added more climate and comfort controls below the screen for quick access and control. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, and Pivi Pro allows for over-the-air updates.\n\nJaguar says the 2021 model’s cabin is a step up thanks to more use of premium materials in front and back like open-pore wood veneers and aluminum trim. Other new creature comforts inside include new waterfall-effect interior lighting and an active noise cancellation system as well as wider, cushier front seats with larger heating and cooling areas. The JaguarDrive Selector got a remake for 2021, too; the prior rotary dial gear selector now looks and feels more like a conventional shifter. Standard interior color choices include Ebony, Light Oyster and Caraway.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nShoppers have two powertrain choices this year: two turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines, one making 246 horsepower and the 296 hp. They carry over from 2020 — as does the eight-speed automatic transmission.  Rear-wheel drive is standard;  all-wheel drive is optional with either engine.\n\nThe biggest powertrain news for 2021 is what didn’t make it to the new model: The 380-hp, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is discontinued.\n\nSafety \n\nA 3D surround-view camera system is standard for 2021. Newly available for 2021 is the Clear Exit Monitor system; it alerts front and rear occupants if a car or cyclist is approaching while they are exiting the vehicle.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJaguar said it expects the XF to go on sale in January.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Few cars strike me as too powerful, but the new Jaguar XFR sport sedan comes awfully close, at least when it comes to driving on public roads. Boasting a 510-horsepower, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8, the XFR demands prudent use of the gas pedal, lest you find yourself at speeds that will have you trading the XFR’s leather bucket seats for the vinyl backseat of a Crown Victoria.\n\nDespite its performance aspirations, the XFR’s surprisingly livable suspension tuning means it’s just as suited to commuting in traffic as it is blasting down an open highway. Indeed, it’s a special blend of comfort and power.\n\nIf 510 hp isn’t your thing, check out our review of the 2010 XF Premium. It’s still a quick car, thanks to its 385-hp V-8 engine.\n\nStealthy Looks\nWith so much power on tap, Jaguar wisely made the XFR something of a “sleeper” — a car with plenty of go-fast potential, but styling that doesn’t draw too much attention. The fact that it’s a sedan helps in this regard, but Jaguar also restrained itself in terms of cosmetic modifications when crafting this R car. Subtle cues include hood vents, a revised front bumper with gaping lower grilles, and standard 20-inch alloy wheels. Our test car’s dark silver paint also helped the XFR blend into the crowd. If you prefer something more eye-catching, brighter colors are available.\n\nSupercharged V-8 Power\nThere are all kinds of driving situations, like pulling into traffic or merging onto the highway, that are made easier by having a powerful engine. The XFR’s supercharged V-8, however, is the kind of engine that can take you from 70 to 90 mph in a few seconds. No daily driver needs that kind of capability, but that’s the power this V-8 delivers. Mash the gas pedal, and the surge of power will snap your head back. Jaguar cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.7 seconds, which is pretty good for a car that weighs 4,306 pounds. EPA-estimated gas mileage is 15/21 mpg city/highway, which means the XFR avoids a gas-guzzler tax.\n\nThe way this V-8 makes its power is as impressive as how it moves the XFR. It’s not an unruly engine — whether you’re talking about its idle smoothness or the sound it makes — and it doesn’t get too loud when accelerating; the quad tailpipes emit a deep, pleasing rumble. Everything about it says luxury-oriented V-8 … everything but its extra 200 hp, that is.\n\nEven though the V-8 is supercharged, even gearhead passengers will be hard-pressed to know that from the sound, as it makes only the slightest supercharger whine now and then. The V-8 is force-fed air through a Roots-type supercharger that’s also used in the high-performance Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, and it’s just as at home in the XFR.\n\nChanneling the supercharged V-8’s power is a six-speed automatic transmission. It has a big job to do, and it does it well. The transmission makes smooth shifts during leisurely driving and willingly kicks down when you want to accelerate.\n\nThe automatic includes paddle shifters on the steering wheel, as well as a Sport mode that’s selected from the console gear selector. Sport mode holds gears longer before upshifting, keeping engine rpm higher and making the car feel more responsive, as well as providing some engine braking when you take your foot off the gas pedal.\n\nIt takes only light brake-pedal pressure to get strong stopping power, but the pedal’s progression isn’t the most linear, and the brakes can be a bit grabby.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe performance-oriented XFR’s ride-quality tradeoff is surprisingly minimal compared with an XF Premium, which is powered by a non-supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 and has a relatively firm ride to begin with. That means you can use the XFR as a daily driver without it punishing you on the morning and evening commute. The suspension tuning is firmer than an XF’s, no question, but it’s supple enough to damp big bumps in the road.\n\nThat said, the XFR’s suspension is still sensitive to road surfaces, and it communicates to the cabin minor pavement variations that you can’t see. Roads that look smooth may in fact have lots of little dips and rises in them, and when driving the XFR you’ll know all about them. It feels like the car is constantly at work, as it’s always adjusting to the road.\n\nThe XFR comes standard with Jaguar’s Adaptive Dynamics adaptive suspension. The electronically controlled system’s damping properties are adjusted on the fly to accommodate changing road conditions and driver behavior. The XFR also includes a Dynamic Mode that, in addition to changing the gas pedal, transmission and stability system characteristics, also adjusts the suspension. The suspension changes aren’t the most apparent, though; the ride is just a tad firmer.\n\nFor a luxury sport sedan, the XFR offers quite a bit of steering feedback, yet still retains the light-effort feel that’s common among luxury sedans. The steering is reasonably responsive, too, and the car quickly changes directions when you want it to.\n\nThe sedan also stays pretty flat when cornering hard, with the front bucket seats’ side bolsters holding you in place. You do feel the weight of this car in corners, though.\n\nThe Inside\nThere are a lot of theatrics in the XFR’s cabin. One of the more interesting features is a heartbeat-like pulsing light from the car’s start button before you turn on the car. It’s a little weird on one level and kind of cool on another.\n\nThere’s more. When you press the beating-heart button to awaken the XFR, the gear selector knob rises from a hole in the console and the dashboard vents rotate open. All in all, there’s a lot going on, which really stands out because the cabin’s styling is otherwise simple and restrained.\n\nLess impressive is the appearance of many of the car’s buttons and switches, which have a silver finish that looks low rent in an $80,000 luxury car. At night, the interior is bathed in cool-blue ambient light.\n\nThe bucket seats are covered in standard leather upholstery and have firm, supportive cushioning. The seats also have power-adjustable side bolsters and bottom cushions that can be moved independent of the backrest.\n\nSafety\nStandard XF safety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows and active head restraints for the front seats. Models with adaptive cruise control, which is standard on the XFR, gain Jaguar’s Advanced Emergency Brake Assist system, which will sound a warning and prepare the brakes for stronger performance if the system determines a collision may occur.\n\nCheck out the Standard Equipment & Specs page for a full list of safety features.\n\nXFR in the Market\nThe XFR and cars like it cater to a select crowd of enthusiasts, and if I had the means I’d probably count myself as a member of that group. There’s no question you pay a hefty premium to be part of the club, as the XFR costs roughly $20,000 more than the XF Premium — a less powerful but still very satisfying car.\n\nWith the XFR, Jaguar has enhanced the good qualities of the XF Premium without introducing any overly objectionable characteristics, and that’s quite a feat. It makes the incredible performance that much more gratifying.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Democracy runs amok when we try to democratize everything, including luxury. That’s especially true in the global automobile industry, which is fond of slipping its products into narrowly hewn slots to justify price differentials.\n\nWe have, for example, this week’s subject automobile, the 2011 Jaguar XF. It is what the industry calls an “entry-level luxury” offering, which, in this case, means it costs less than its “affordable luxury” Jaguar siblings the XF Premium and XF Supercharged – both of which are priced below the bona fide luxurious Jaguar XK and XJ models.\n\nAlso, we have the Jaguar R-Collection, which includes the XFR, XKR and XKR Convertible. In Jaguar parlance, the “R” bespeaks top luxury, invoking Jaguar’s racing heritage in content, styling and performance.\n\nFor the moment, there is no “R” version of the Jaguar XJ sedan. But there is the long-wheelbase “L” iteration of that car, including the truly fancy XJL Supercharged and XJL Supersport models.\n\nThe point is, in the Jaguar crowd, the base XF is a poor cousin, the scion of a family with a noble name, but in reality not much different from a slew of substantially less expensive non-exotic cars in terms of build quality, amenities, safety and performance.\n\nIt is a thought that haunted me on a recent 300-mile drive here from my home in Northern Virginia.\n\nCertainly, the Jaguar XF’s 5-liter V-8 engine – 385 horsepower, 380 foot-pounds of torque – is a lot of fun. But it offered no more enjoyment than the recently driven Volvo XC60 R-Design wagon with its 3.2-liter in-line six-cylinder engine (240 horsepower, 236 foot-pounds of torque).\n\nAcceleration in both vehicles was super-smooth. Both handled wonderfully well on turnpikes and highways. But while behind the wheel of the Jaguar, I found myself longing for the Volvo, which costs $14,450 less.\n\nIt is what happens when marketing – what car companies want you to believe about the car you are driving – collides with the reality of having driven many other automobiles.\n\nArtificial categories such as “entry-level luxury” and “family” (a.k.a. “mainstream”) tend to lose their meaning where the rubber meets the road.\n\nFor example, I would take the seats in the Volvo XC60 wagon over those in the Jaguar XF sedan any day, any trip. The Volvo’s seats are exceptionally comfortable, embracing. The Jaguar’s are marginally comfortable, tiring after a long drive. Under the circumstance, “entry-level luxury” does not please me nearly as much as “family” or “mainstream.”\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with age. The older my body gets, the less impressed it is with prestige. The more appreciative it is of comfort and safety. Luxury thus becomes redefined.\n\nTechnology also is forcing redefinition. In its purest sense, for example, luxury speaks to exclusiveness, access to something unavailable to almost everyone else. But the Jaguar XF has little that can’t be found at a much lower price on a well-equipped Buick LaCrosse, Volvo S60 sedan or XC60 wagon, or, for that matter, a Hyundai Genesis sedan or coupe.\n\nStart with safety. The Jaguar XF offers standard ventilated front and rear disc brakes. The Buick LaCrosse CXS and Hyundai Genesis sedan offer equally effective all-wheel disc brakes (ventilated front, solid rear) for thousands of dollars less. Multiple air bags, found in the Jaguar XF, can be found in many other cars that few people would deem luxurious. Emerging safety technologies, such as blind-side warning systems, designed to alert motorists to nearby trailing vehicles, are better designed and installed in family haulers such as the new Honda Odyssey minivan than they are in the more costly Jaguar XF.\n\nAmenities such as onboard navigation, backup camera, parking proximity warning system, premium sound system and connectivity for multiple infotainment devices come with the Jaguar XF. They are also found on many other vehicles of lesser stature and price.\n\nSomething is amiss here. And it just might be that the global automobile industry’s vehicle slotting scheme, more in place to justify prices than it is to intelligently differentiate vehicles sold, makes no real sense anymore.",

      "expert_review": "I really liked the 2012 Jaguar XF. It’s that simple. There’s little about the luxury sport sedan that isn’t wonderful, but it’s not perfect (what is?); its fuel-economy numbers are low and it takes premium gas.\n\nJaguar has created a remarkably fun-to-drive luxury car that doesn’t feel or look ostentatious. The five-seater has a great price tag for all the fun and pampering it brings to the table.\n\nI’m not saying it’s cheap, but the base model’s starting price is $53,875, including an $875 destination charge. My Portfolio-trim test car, which starts at $59,875, rang up at $67,000, but it had just about every bell and whistle you can imagine, even a heated windshield.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe XF is a study in understated, modern elegance. The low roofline and high door sills create a sleek line, and the sculpted hood strikes an elegant vibe. My test car’s grille is a black mesh that’s surrounded by a chrome bezel, and it strikes the right balance between sport and beauty. The headlamps incorporate sinewy LED daytime running lamps.\n\nEntering the XF was easy for my kids, though smaller children need a little help the first few times getting in and out. Parents are guaranteed a few head bonks with that rear-sloping roofline when getting infants and toddlers loaded into child-safety seats. Otherwise, the XF is completely welcoming.\n\nThe 17.7-cubic-foot trunk could handle a medium- to large-sized grocery trip or a smaller haul from a membership warehouse. Too many boxes of diapers will max it out, though.\n\nMy test car, the XF Portfolio, had the standard engine, a 385-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8, that’s paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway and uses premium gas. Two supercharged V-8 engines are available.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great for a family of four\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe XF’s black-colored interior is swathed in leather upholstery, including a simulated suede headliner that made me feel like a gem nestled in a fancy gift box. All the buttons and knobs had luxurious chrome bezels or leather covers. The glove box only required the casual brush of my hand over a button to open it. However, the same brush of my hand on the headliner left prints.\n\nOnce I was settled in the driver’s seat and pushed the glowing red push-start button, the gearshift knob appeared out of the center console and the air vents, which were hidden behind closed panels on the dash, flipped open in a quiet tumble. I loved the abundance of storage in the center console, which housed cupholders and additional space for my smartphone.\n\nThe bolstered, power-adjustable driver’s seat enabled me to find the perfect position (you’d be surprised how often this isn’t the case). No detail went unattended in the XF. After just a brief acclimation period, the multimedia system was easy to understand and use.\n\nIn the backseat, my school-aged kids loved the air vents that they could aim right at their faces. They also enjoyed the optional power rear sunshade. They even marveled at the pretty carpet, which they no doubt noticed because we had been carpet shopping recently. If your rear passengers are persnickety, they may notice the backseat doesn’t have the same level of niceties as the front row, but it is still a wonderful place to be, and the kids commented more than once that this was their favorite sedan test car (as opposed to an SUV or coupe).\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe XF’s three-seat bench has two sets of lower Latch anchors and easily accommodated child-safety seats. The anchors were easy to locate and access with my seat’s traditional hooklike connectors. However, larger rigid Latch connectors were difficult to use in this car, according to Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nRear-facing car seats fit well in the XF without too much legroom compromise by the front passenger. Booster seats also fit fine. I was happy to see the seat belt buckles weren’t floppy, though they did have a tendency to retreat into the seat bench. This is a major frustration for smaller kids in boosters.\n\nThe 2012 Jaguar XF has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints, auto-leveling adaptive headlights, a backup camera with front and rear parking sensors, and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nActive cruise control and a blind spot warning system are optional.\n\nThe 2012 XF hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Higway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Jaguar XF here.",

      "expert_review": "Jaguar’s 2013 XF sedan still looks good and handles well, but the addition of a turbocharged four-cylinder base engine and poorly tuned eight-speed automatic has taken the roar out of this cat.\n\nThere’s a trend afoot in luxury cars: Keep all the style and luxury amenities, but offer a smaller, boosted (turbocharged or supercharged) motor to improve fuel economy. Everybody is doing it, from Range Rover to Jaguar, which has added a new turbocharged four-cylinder engine and eight-speed transmission to its entry-level XF sedan for the 2013 model year. It’s meant to give American buyers the option of better gas mileage plus all the style and hot elements that make Jaguars appealing. Jaguar has also added available all-wheel drive (AWD) for 2013, remedying a competitive disadvantage. See the changes between 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nFor 2013, the new powertrain begs the question: Can a Jaguar still be sexy, even if it has no fangs?\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nLooks Like a Jag, Doesn’t Run Like One\nIt’s not hard to believe the Jaguar XF’s style is nearly 6 years old now. While it still looks attractive, elements of its shape have made their way onto other brands’ cars, making the Jaguar look a bit too familiar. The Tesla Model S mimics its overall look quite closely (one passerby even thought it was the Tesla), while other elements have shown up on cars like the late Pontiac G8 and the current Kia Optima. The XF is still sleek and shapely, but it’s no longer the head-turner it once was.\n\nThe shape may be familiar, but the base powertrain is new: a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder known in the Ford world as an EcoBoost engine. (Though Ford no longer owns the Jaguar brand, it still supplies this engine.) It makes 240 brake-horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque, which are not pulse-pounding numbers. That power is channeled to the rear wheels through a new eight-speed automatic transmission, and this is where the problems really start.\n\nJust like in the larger XJ sedan we tested earlier this year (see the review), the eight-speed in the Jaguar XF puts fuel economy above performance. As such, kickdowns are slow, acceleration lags and the overall experience makes the car feel underpowered. It’s not; put the transmission into Sport mode or switch the car into its Dynamic setting and the computer keeps the engine in a sweet spot for driving fun. Unfortunately, keeping it in Sport or Dynamic mode means the transmission stays in lower gears when cruising, which will quickly show up in inferior gas mileage numbers, at least partly defeating the car’s modest mileage gains.\n\nThe car’s smaller engine is meant to boost your gas mileage, but the EPA ratings aren’t hugely impressive. The base Jaguar XF comes in at 19/30/23 mpg city/highway/combined. I averaged 20.3 mpg in my tester, sticking mostly to city streets and driving it in a more sporting manner than the EPA does when testing. But that gas mileage is not much better than the optional supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, which drops fuel economy just 2 mpg across the board while offering 100 more hp, a zero-to-60 time of just 5.7 seconds and performance that’s far more befitting a Jaguar.\n\nAcceleration with the four-cylinder is only moderately quick, with Jaguar rating the car’s zero-to-60 time at 7.5 seconds, but that doesn’t accurately reflect its driving feel — it feels slower. The uninspiring performance is accompanied by a soundtrack from the exhaust pipes that is decidedly un-Jaguar; there’s just no way to make a turbo-four sound visceral and powerful. Thankfully, the car is still fun to toss around. Jaguar has tuned the car beautifully for ride and handling, with a good balance between sporty steering, comfortable ride quality and excellent body control.\n\nInterior\nInside, Jaguar’s take on the entry luxury sedan is definitely different from its competitors. Lots of high-quality brushed metal and piano-black trim adorned my tester, which was equipped with an optional Sport Portfolio Pack. A faux suede headliner, premium carpeting and mats, and special soft-grain leather seats (in a rather unfortunate orange hue) are all meant to push the Jag to the “sporty-luxury” end of the scale. The controls are decently laid out, but many feel gimmicky: The air vents disappear behind covers when the climate control is switched off, and the transmission shifter is a rotary knob that pops up from the center console when the engine is started. Given Jaguar’s less-than-stellar reputation for reliability, one wonders how durable such fancy elements will prove to be.\n\nAt night, the center console and dashboard light up with color and lighting schemes that are either “Tron”-like or resemble an old Motorola Razr phone, depending on your frame of reference. It’s definitely unique and may look pretty cool again in another 30 years, but right now it’s starting to look dated. Other Jaguars in the company’s lineup have much more elegant interiors, making the Jaguar XF something of an anomaly for the brand. Seat comfort is quite good, though, with full adjustability at your fingertips and a decent amount of room for front-seat passengers; backseat dwellers will not be nearly as happy, as everything from the door opening to the legroom and headroom is tight.\n\nThe multimedia system is acceptable, with a smallish touch-screen nestled high in the dashboard that presents navigation and audio system information in a simple format. The premium Meridian sound system is quite good and offers levels of adjustability not seen in some competitors, with several selectable sound profiles to fine-tune the sound to your tastes.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test results are not yet available for the Jaguar XF.\n\nThe Jaguar XF features plenty of standard safety equipment, including anti-lock brakes, front and side airbags for the driver and front passenger, as well as side curtain airbags. My test car included an optional blind spot warning system. See all the XF’s safety features here.\n\nXF in the Market\nWith nearly all luxury sedans, base prices tend to climb quickly when you visit the options list, and the XF is no exception. My test car started at $47,870 including an $895 destination charge, but quickly climbed to an as-tested price of $68,175 thanks to several high-end option packages. The Premium Package cost $4,250 and added navigation, satellite radio, adaptive headlamps, a backup camera and parking assist sensors. Keyless entry, voice controls, the blind spot warning system, a power rear sunshade and a few other electronic features come with the $2,500 Convenience Package. But the big jump comes with the 20-Inch Portfolio Sport Package: $10,150 for heated and cooled front sport seats, an upgraded-leather interior, exterior cosmetic changes and 20-inch alloy wheels. It makes the $2,300 Meridian surround-sound audio option seem like a bargain. Additional costs included the $600 split folding rear seat and $525 for a black headliner.\n\nAt the base price, the Jaguar XF competes with midsize luxury cars like the BMW 528i, which also features a 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine for roughly the same price as the base XF. Move to a Mercedes-Benz E-Class, however, and your base engine is a much more powerful V-6 for a few thousand dollars more, or for 2014, a torquey and super-efficient four-cylinder turbo-diesel for a few thousand beyond that. If you want to include a Japanese brand in the mix, the Lexus GS 350 stacks up well, also featuring a more powerful base V-6.\n\nMy car’s as-tested price was a bit ridiculous. For the same money, you can get the Jaguar XF’s far more powerful V-8 Supercharged trim and a few more standard features, or instead you could go for a slightly smaller Audi S4 (with standard AWD) and pocket nearly $20,000. Compare the XF versus its competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2013 about the 2013 Jaguar XF 2.0T. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nJaguar’s 2013 XF sedan still looks good and handles well, but the addition of a turbocharged four-cylinder base engine and poorly tuned eight-speed automatic has taken the roar out of this cat.\n\nThere’s a trend afoot in luxury cars: Keep all the style and luxury amenities, but offer a smaller, boosted (turbocharged or supercharged) motor to improve fuel economy. Everybody is doing it, including Jaguar, which has added a new turbocharged four-cylinder engine and eight-speed transmission to its entry-level XF sedan for 2013. It’s meant to give American buyers the option of better gas mileage plus all the style and hot elements that make Jaguars appealing. Jaguar has also added available all-wheel drive for 2013, remedying a competitive disadvantage. See the changes between 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nFor 2013, the new powertrain begs the question: Can a Jaguar still be sexy, even if it has no fangs?\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nLooks Like a Jag, Doesn’t Run Like One\nIt’s not hard to believe the XF’s style is nearly 6 years old now. While it still looks attractive, elements of its shape have made their way onto other brands’ cars, making the Jaguar look a bit too familiar. The Tesla Model S mimics its overall look quite closely (one passerby even thought it was the Tesla), while other elements have shown up on cars like the late Pontiac G8 and the current Kia Optima. The XF is still sleek and shapely, but it’s no longer the head-turner it once was.\n\nThe shape may be familiar, but the base powertrain is new: a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder known in the Ford world as an EcoBoost engine. (Though Ford no longer owns the Jaguar brand, it still supplies this engine.) It makes 240 horsepower and 251 pounds-feet of torque, which are not pulse-pounding numbers. That power is channeled to the rear wheels through a new eight-speed automatic transmission, and this is where the problems really start.\n\nJust like in the larger XJ sedan we tested earlier this year (see the review), the eight-speed in the XF puts fuel economy above performance. As such, kickdowns are slow, acceleration lags and the overall experience makes the car feel underpowered. It’s not; put the transmission into Sport mode or switch the car into its Dynamic setting and the computer keeps the engine in a sweet spot for driving fun. Unfortunately, keeping it in Sport or Dynamic mode means the transmission stays in lower gears when cruising, which will quickly show up in inferior gas mileage numbers, at least partly defeating the car’s modest mileage gains.\n\nThe car’s smaller engine is meant to boost your gas mileage, but the EPA ratings aren’t hugely impressive. The base XF comes in at 19/30/23 mpg city/highway/combined. I averaged 20.3 mpg in my tester, sticking mostly to city streets and driving it in a more sporting manner than the EPA does when testing. But that gas mileage is not much better than the optional supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, which drops fuel economy just 2 mpg across the board while offering 100 more hp, a zero-to-60 time of just 5.7 seconds and performance that’s far more befitting a Jaguar.\n\nAcceleration with the four-cylinder is only moderately quick, with Jaguar rating the car’s zero-to-60 time at 7.5 seconds, but that doesn’t accurately reflect its driving feel — it feels slower. The uninspiring performance is accompanied by a soundtrack from the exhaust pipes that is decidedly un-Jaguar; there’s just no way to make a turbo-four sound visceral and powerful. Thankfully, the car is still fun to toss around. Jaguar has tuned the car beautifully for ride and handling, with a good balance between sporty steering, comfortable ride quality and excellent body control.\n\nInterior\nInside, Jaguar’s take on the entry luxury sedan is definitely different from its competitors. Lots of high-quality brushed metal and piano-black trim adorned my tester, which was equipped with an optional Sport Portfolio Pack. A faux suede headliner, premium carpeting and mats, and special soft-grain leather (in a rather unfortunate orange hue) are all meant to push the Jag to the “sporty-luxury” end of the scale. The controls are decently laid out, but many feel gimmicky: The air vents disappear behind covers when the climate control is switched off, and the transmission shifter is a rotary knob that pops up from the center console when the engine is started. Given Jaguar’s less-than-stellar reputation for reliability, one wonders how durable such fancy elements will prove to be.\n\nAt night, the center console and dashboard light up with color and lighting schemes that are either “Tron”-like or resemble an old Motorola Razr phone, depending on your frame of reference. It’s definitely unique and may look pretty cool again in another 30 years, but right now it’s starting to look dated. Other Jaguars in the company’s lineup have much more elegant interiors, making the XF something of an anomaly for the brand. Seat comfort is quite good, though, with full adjustability at your fingertips and a decent amount of room for front-seat passengers; backseat dwellers will not be nearly as happy, as everything from the door opening to the legroom and headroom is tight.\n\nThe multimedia system is acceptable, with a smallish touch-screen nestled high in the dashboard that presents navigation and audio system information in a simple format. The premium Meridian sound system is quite good and offers levels of adjustability not seen in some competitors, with several selectable sound profiles to fine-tune the sound to your tastes.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test results are not yet available for the Jaguar XF.\n\nThe XF features plenty of standard safety equipment, including front and side airbags for the driver and front passenger, as well as side curtain airbags. My test car included an optional blind spot warning system. See all the XF’s safety features here.\n\nXF in the Market\nWith nearly all luxury sedans, base prices tend to climb quickly when you visit the options list, and the XF is no exception. My test car started at $47,870 including an $895 destination charge, but quickly climbed to an as-tested price of $68,175 thanks to several high-end option packages. The Premium Package cost $4,250 and added navigation, satellite radio, adaptive headlamps, a backup camera and parking assist sensors. Keyless entry, voice controls, the blind spot warning system, a power rear sunshade and a few other electronic features come with the $2,500 Convenience Package. But the big jump comes with the 20-Inch Portfolio Sport Package: $10,150 for heated and cooled front sport seats, an upgraded-leather interior, exterior cosmetic changes and 20-inch wheels. It makes the $2,300 Meridian surround-sound audio option seem like a bargain. Additional costs included the $600 split folding rear seat and $525 for a black headliner. Build one for yourself here.\n\nAt the base price, the XF competes with midsize luxury cars like the BMW 528i, which also features a 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine for roughly the same price as the base XF. Move to a Mercedes-Benz E-Class, however, and your base engine is a much more powerful V-6 for a few thousand dollars more, or for 2014, a torquey and super-efficient four-cylinder turbo-diesel for a few thousand beyond that. If you want to include a Japanese brand in the mix, the Lexus GS 350 stacks up well, also featuring a more powerful base V-6.\n\nMy car’s as-tested price was a bit ridiculous. For the same money, you can get the XF’s far more powerful V-8 Supercharged trim and a few more standard features, or instead you could go for a slightly smaller Audi S4 and pocket nearly $20,000. Compare the XF versus its competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Carmakers are always updating their products; one day, a car offers the latest and greatest styling and amenities. Then, as time passes, it slides toward the back of the pack. So it is with Jaguar and its XF.\n\nThe 2015 Jaguar XF is a luxury car that looks good at a distance, but up close even its strong engine and transmission can’t overshadow the fact that it’s been left behind as its competitors have improved.\n\nThe XF is being redesigned for 2016, and the new version is expected to hit dealerships in the winter of 2015. For now, 2015 models remain available. Learn more about the 2016 version here.\n\nThe Jaguar XF competes with midsize luxury sedans like the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Compare them here.\n\nWe tested a 2015 Jaguar XF 3.0 Portfolio with all-wheel drive. This model is one step above the base model in the XF lineup.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Jaguar XF is a collection of curves and rounded edges that looks muscular and remarkably fresh for a car that’s kept largely the same look since its debut in 2009. (Its front end was restyled in 2012.)\n\nUnlike sedans that are more angular and upright, the Jaguar XF is stretched out, which is best seen from the rear angle.\n\nBased on what we saw at the 2015 New York International Auto Show, the 2016 model seems to preserve this look despite having its dimensions shifted around. Styling, then, isn’t as likely to swing shoppers toward one generation or another as it might have with a radical change.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Jaguar XF is at its best on the highway, where the combination of its 340-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, transmission, all-wheel drive and supple ride work together for a good luxury-car experience.\n\nThat’s far from the only choice Jaguar shoppers have as far as XF engines go. In addition to the 3.0-liter V-6 we tested, there’s also a 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 510-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8; and a 550-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 in the XFR-S.\n\nWith the V-6 we tested, you don’t feel like you need to rush. When you decide to pass, though, the XF is able to get up and do it without a ton of warning. The steering is light, so you’re not getting a workout, but I still felt some connection to the road at high speeds. That’s a good thing.\n\nAround town, the XF deserves praise for how well the transmission behaves. Unlike some other transmissions with more than five speeds, the XF’s doesn’t hunt for gears or upshift too quickly, preventing darting moves. There’s a small area around 40 mph where I consistently found the XF to be in too high of a gear, but overall I think the transmission is pretty well-sorted-out.\n\nThe 2016 XF will be powered by one of two supercharged V-6 engines, with the choice of a 340-hp base model and a 380-hp XF S. Both will pair with an eight-speed automatic, though XF models with rear-wheel drive will get a lighter, more compact transmission than all-wheel-drive models.\n\nHandling is good for a luxury car. When pressed, the Jaguar felt heavy and a bit too soft for really serious action, but it never felt like it was wallowing around. Jaguar also sells two higher-performance versions of the XF — the XFR and the XFR-S — for people who really want screaming performance. The XF we tested wouldn’t compete with those fire-breathers, and having that clear delineation between the models is nice.\n\nThat’s not to say the XF is only able to putter along as a luxury cruiser. It features Sport and Dynamic modes that both sharpen the transmission, letting it hold onto gears longer before upshifting and generally making the XF much more responsive. In addition, the XF with the supercharged 3.0-liter engine, as well as XFR and XFR-S models, have an adaptive suspension with electronic dampers to better adjust to the road. Dynamic mode alters suspension response in those cars.\n\nThose are the high points. The XF, like more and more cars these days, has stop-start technology to shut off the engine when the car is at a stop to save fuel. There are two things to note with the Jaguar system: First, the system locks the steering wheel (other systems let you turn the steering wheel, even if that necessitates the engine starting up again), and second, the system is obtrusive. You’ll really notice the engine shutting off and turning back on. Others in this class do it better, and it’s something Jaguar should improve in the 2016 model.\n\nFinally, as far as mileage is concerned, the XF is estimated to get 17/27/20 mpg city/highway/combined with the 3.0-liter V-6 we tested. That model is the only XF with all-wheel drive. With the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and rear-wheel drive, the XF is rated 19/30/23 mpg city/highway/combined. The 510-hp, 5.0 liter V-8 engine is rated 15/23/18 mpg, while the XFR-S’ 550-hp V-8 has not been tested by the EPA.\n\nInterior\nHere’s where I think the XF starts to show it needs an update, or at least some attention. Right off the bat, my eyes spotted two pieces of aluminum trim that didn’t line up. That shouldn’t happen in any car, but especially not in one that costs more than $61,000 as equipped.\n\nAlso, Jaguar says the wood trim is a veneer of real wood. A different approach might be warranted. It’s not just that I’m not a fan of wood trim, it’s that the veneer is so thin that when you tap it or touch it, it doesn’t feel like wood. I thought it was painted metal, and that’s not good.\n\nJaguar uses a rotary gear selector that rises from the center console when the car is started. Likewise, the climate control vents aren’t visible in the dash until the car is started. They rotate into view as the gear selector rises. Some people may like all that motion when they enter the car, but the effect was wasted on me.\n\nThe XF is fairly roomy up front; I didn’t feel cramped when I was driving. The backseat is a different story. The seatback’s angle forced me into a reclining position that wasn’t particularly comfortable. Also, my knees were raised fairly high, so the overall impression was of a place I could ride in a pinch, but not a place I wanted to be for more than half an hour or so. For 2016, the XF will bump out slightly in every direction for the rear seat, and I’ll be curious to see if Jaguar is able to change the angle of the rear seatback to my liking.\n\nVisibility in the XF is mixed. On the highway I noticed no discernible blind spots, and that’s nice. Around town, however, visibility out front is compromised by both the windshield pillars and the location of the side mirrors. I never felt confident driving the XF around pedestrians because of it.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe multimedia system/climate control touch-screen is where Jaguar has the most work to do in order to haul the XF up to the rest of its class. The screen itself is small and has disappointing graphics, and because it’s small the buttons by which you input destinations into the nav or adjust climate settings are hard to use.\n\nFurther, the system requires too many inputs to make changes, and the inputs are not intuitive. The best example is turning on the heated/ventilated seats. You can either press a button on the dash, bringing up a menu that allows you to select either heating or ventilating, or you can press the climate menu on the screen, select “seats” from that menu, then select whether you want heat or ventilating. I think I could drive from our offices in downtown Chicago to Wrigley Field in less time than it would take me to use either method to adjust the seat temperature.\n\nTo that end, the system lags, meaning you press the screen … there’s a pause … then the system reacts. That’s unacceptable, and Jaguar must do better.\n\nThe rest of the XF’s ergonomics are in the decent-to-good range. Most other controls fall where you’d expect them to and largely work well.\n\nThe rotary gear selection deserves special praise. It’s the best I’ve used, as it feels substantial and the gear selections are noted with a very distinct click. Also, to shift from the normal Drive mode to Sport, you must press the gear selector down and then rotate. Jaguar’s system does this very well, giving you a clear sense of when you’ve pushed the selector down far enough to select Sport. (I still remain un-wowed by the rising-from-the-console bit.)\n\nCargo & Storage\nThere’s little that’s remarkable about the XF in this area. There’s a decent-sized center console, which is large enough for the larger smartphones permeating the market. The cupholders are on the smaller size, but carried my average-sized travel mug well.\n\nThe trunk does well carrying luggage and groceries, but it’s an odd shape, so it’s not as accommodating as others in the class.\n\nSafety\nThe Jaguar XF has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nApart from six airbags and required safety features, the XF we drove came only with a blind spot monitoring system that indicated a car in the blind spot only with a light in the side mirror, not both a light and an audible chime or vibration alert.\n\nThere are also few advanced safety options available for the 2015 XF, but Jaguar aims to rectify this with the 2016 redesign. Autonomous Emergency Braking, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist and a drowsy driver monitor are planned for the 2016 model year.\n\nYou can browse the 2015 Jaguar XF’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe XF is an old car in need of an update to keep up with the rest of its class. So, as you might expect, if you want the latest and greatest technology — especially safety features — waiting for the 2016 XF is the prudent choice.\n\nOverall, the 2015 XF has its charms. It’s got a strong drivetrain, and it’s nice to drive on long highway trips. But from the cramped rear seat to the paucity of safety options — and the price — there are many reasons buyers would be wise to wait until they can at least sit in and test drive a 2016 model before committing to buy the last of the 2015 XFs.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2016 Jaguar XF’s incremental changes deliver a more refined, athletic and comfortable four-door car that’s also an unlikely bargain.\n\nVersus the competition: While its redesign doesn’t blow away competitors, this 2016 midsize sedan stands out for its light weight, steering and well-executed electronics.\n\nWhere the 2015 XF offered a turbocharged four-cylinder, supercharged V-6 and a choice of supercharged V-8s, the 2016 model year starts with only a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. The new entry-level engine, a turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder, will come later in the model year. (See the two model years compared.)\n\nThere are two main XF types: the XF 35t and the XF S. I drove both. The 35t’s engine produces 340 horsepower, while the XF S has 380 hp, functions of different supercharger boost pressure. The 35t comes in Premium, Prestige and R-Sport trim levels, while the XF S stands alone. Both come with an eight-speed automatic transmission and the choice of rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nThe XF competes with the likes of the Audi A6, BMW 535i, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Cadillac CTS (see them compared side by side).\n\nExterior & Styling\nThere wasn’t much wrong with the 2015 Jaguar XF midsize sedan, which might explain the mild, evolutionary approach Jaguar took in redesigning it for 2016. Without a tutor, you probably wouldn’t recognize the differences in exterior styling. The 2016 has lost 0.1 inch in overall length, but the wheelbase is 2 inches longer for more interior space, which helps differentiate the XF from the upcoming XE compact sedan.\n\nThe current trim levels look similar, the primary difference being the S trim’s lack of the metallic-look crossbars that sit over lower trim levels’ outboard air vents in the front bumper. Standard wheels include 18-inch alloys for the Premium trim level, 19s for the middle trims and 20s for the XF S. Xenon headlights are standard; adaptive LED headlights start out optional but are included in the R-Sport and S.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe engine provides plenty of power for quick sprints off the line as well as high-speed passing. The standard eight-speed transmission is reasonably responsive. It’s unfortunate I have to describe it that way, but today’s eight- and nine-speed transmissions frequently exhibit a lot of lag and gear-hunting. The Jaguar XF’s is better than average. In passing maneuvers, the transmission did a stair-step, two-gear kickdown rather than hopping directly down a couple of gears — but at least it pulled ahead in the brief interim gear rather than bogging down completely. Was the six-speed automatic, which was abandoned in 2013, a better experience? Hell yes, but it was also less efficient.\n\nThe differences between the 340- and 380-hp versions of the engine are so small I don’t think I’d even bother marketing it. The torque ratings are the same — 332 pounds-feet at 4,500 rpm — and both engines hit peak horsepower at 6,500 rpm. Jaguar estimates zero-to-60-mph times of 5.2 and 5.1 seconds with rear-wheel drive, a difference you simply don’t feel in your butt — even if your butt is British.\n\nTurning the rotary-knob gear selector from D to S activates a transmission Sport mode that mitigates the kickdown steps by holding on to lower gears longer. There’s a selectable Dynamic mode — along with Normal, Eco and Winter modes — that activates the transmission’s Sport mode. It also brings more aggressive throttle response, lower power-steering assist and sportier suspension settings with the optional adaptive suspension, which both cars I drove featured. Even better, a configurable menu on the touch-screen lets you select which of these attributes change when you activate Dynamic mode. In some cars, those settings are predetermined at the factory.\n\nThe cabin is pretty quiet. Under heavy acceleration, you hear some nice induction and faint supercharger sounds, but Jaguar could have done more with the exhaust note. I think the company went overboard with the F-Type’s loud exhaust, but even I feel Jaguar went too far in the other direction with the XF. When so many competitors have turbos mucking up their exhaust, the supercharged XF had a lot of potential. Opportunity lost.\n\nWith EPA-estimated mileage of 20/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gas, the 2016 XF beats the base 2015 model by 1 mpg combined and the 2015’s V-6 by 2 mpg combined (rear-drive models). The all-wheel-drive 2016’s 20/28/23 mpg beats the comparable 2015 by 3 mpg combined. The XF is now on par with the competing A6, 535i and CTS.\n\nThe brakes are strong and linear, and the handling is a high point — balanced and neutral, with excellent steering response and feedback I’d describe as above average. The A6 has never been strong in the latter department, and the 5 Series is commonly cited as evidence that BMW has gotten too soft. It’s also gotten too heavy. We won’t know how the XF’s upcoming base model will compare with the 528, but the 35t is 320 pounds lighter than a comparably equipped BMW 535i and 408 pounds less than an Audi A6 3.0T, on which all-wheel drive is standard (the all-wheel-drive Jag is 298 pounds lighter than the Audi). Thanks to more extensive use of aluminum, the rear-drive 2016 XF is 132 pounds lighter than the V-6s of 2015, and with an all-wheel-drive system that’s a claimed 16 percent lighter, that version of the 2016 is down an impressive 265 pounds. Jaguar’s new all-wheel drive system — as yet untested — is claimed to send 100 percent of torque to the rear wheels unless it’s needed in front.\n\nYou definitely feel the 2016 Jaguar XF’s lower weight, regardless of your butt’s origin. I wish I could say it’s a revelation, but until I get the car on a racetrack, I’ll call it a welcome attribute in a class that’s largely overweight and overly isolationist.\n\nThough the Continental all-season tires (on 19- and 20-inch alloy wheels) with which my test cars were equipped exhibited admirable grip, it was clear the chassis could handle more. A set of summer performance tires probably would better show the car’s true colors. With the adaptive suspension, the dynamics didn’t come at the expense of ride comfort, even in the sportier setting. The base suspension — which I have yet to drive — has shock absorbers designed to quell high-frequency ripples without sacrificing necessary firmness when needed.\n\nInterior\nThe XF’s interior is appropriately luxurious, with real metal and wood trim – though the combination didn’t look right in one of my cars. Fortunately, some of the materials are a la carte options, depending on trim level. And the purple, disco accent lighting on the center console was truly baffling (see the photo to the right). The apparent Bee Gees feature turned out to be the Configurable Interior Mood Lighting option, which, by grace, allows one to select color as well as intensity.\n\nMy cars had the standard simple but clear gauges with a color head-up display between them. In February 2016, Jaguar will offer an optional, reconfigurable all-digital instrument panel measuring 12.3 inches.\n\nAs in most of this class, the Jaguar XF’s base trim level has imitation leather upholstery and the higher ones have the real thing. (Audi is a notable exception with standard genuine leather seats.) I remained comfortable in the driver’s seat after hundreds of miles. Front legroom is up almost 3 inches for 2016, to a generous 44.4 inches. Only the CTS beats it, with 45.7 inches. The XF’s front headroom increased 0.4 inch to 37.5 inches, which is a few tenths above the A6 but about 3 inches shy of the 5 Series and CTS. It was high enough for me, at 6 feet tall, to drive with the seat raised almost all the way.\n\nThe addition of rear-quarter windows improves rearward visibility a bit versus the 2015, but the car’s high belt line doesn’t help — typical of today’s cars. A standard backup camera aids in parking maneuvers, as do optional 360-degree cameras and a Park Assist feature that sizes up parking spaces and automatically steers the car in and out of them. Those options are available only on the R-Sport and S trims.\n\nTo me, the single biggest impediment to visibility is the optional heated front windshield, which incorporates squiggly wires that I find distracting in daylight and maddening after dark, when they introduce halos around lights. I don’t know how many ice storms you’d have to encounter yearly to make this tradeoff worthwhile, but as a Chicago resident, I find conventional front defoggers are plenty good enough. Also note that electronic toll transponders usually don’t work through these windshields. Sadly, if you want the optional heated seats and steering wheel, in most cases you’re stuck with the squiggles, too.\n\nBy the numbers, the backseat benefits from the longer wheelbase. With just over a half-inch of additional legroom, the XF’s 37.2 inches is two-tenths of an inch behind the A6 and beats the BMW and Caddy by almost 2 inches. Though the spec is higher, it seems like the seat is closer to the floor than in the 2015, which results in elevated knees. The center floor hump is also very high and wide, which limits the center seat’s usefulness.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nIn keeping with other Jaguars, the new XF’s controls are a combination of buttons and a touch-screen rather than a display with a separate multifunction controller. Starting mid-February 2016, the XF will offer an optional, ambitious InControl Touch Pro multimedia system with a 10.2-inch touch-screen. I tested the standard InControl Touch (“Novice” implied), which has an 8-inch touch-screen flanked by buttons that are mechanical rather than the touch-sensitive panels that cheapen some of Land Rover’s vehicles. Where some Jaguar and Land Rover touch-screens are painfully slow, this base XF system is a newer version that reacts more quickly to touch. It does the job and includes InControl Apps, a smartphone interface for both Android and Apple. Though Jaguar has announced it will adopt Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, they are not currently available.\n\nA navigation system is optional, as is Wi-Fi hot-spot functionality. We can debate how useful an in-car hot spot is, but not that 4G cellular speeds (now the norm) would be better than the XF’s 3G.\n\nThe standard Meridian audio system includes AM and FM radio, USB and analog aux-in jacks and Bluetooth streaming audio with hands-free phone support. Satellite radio (subscription required) is an option. This stereo sounds quite good, so you might be able to live without the optional Meridian surround sound system, which adds over $3,000 — and a CD player.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe XF’s trunk is rated to have a staggering 19.1 cubic feet of cargo volume — more than a cubic foot more than the 2015 and roughly 5 cubic feet more than the Audi, BMW and Cadillac. And it seems that large. It swallowed a couple of roll aboard suitcases and still left the majority of the trunk wide open. The backseat folds in a 40/20/40 split.\n\nInterior storage is less impressive. The glove compartment and door pockets are OK, but there’s room under the center armrest for little more than the audio and 12-volt jacks found there. A phone would make it.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Jaguar XF hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication. Unfortunately, because Jaguar is a relatively low-volume brand, its cars are seldom tested.\n\nIn addition to the usual complement of airbags, the Jaguar XF offers such active-safety options as forward collision warning with autonomous braking, which operates between 3 and 50 mph and sees cars but not pedestrians (the latter will debut on the Jaguar F-Pace SUV). There’s also lane departure warning and prevention and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. The blind spot warning is uncommonly accurate, seeming to know the definition of a blind spot (not visible in the mirrors); most vehicles trigger an alert when a vehicle is anywhere behind you.\n\nThe Jaguar XF also excels in the adjustability of some of these features: Lane Keep Assist lets you choose Normal or High Sensitivity, so the feature either corrects egregious wandering out of your lane or essentially steers for you, respectively. The adaptive cruise control, which operates all the way to a stop and can then accelerate again, can be turned off, leaving conventional cruise control. Most vehicles offer only conventional or adaptive cruise.\n\nSee all the XF’s safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nFor 2016, Jaguar XF prices range from $52,895 to $66,695, including destination fee, representing a $5,275 price decrease from the 2015 V-6 version (there’s no entry-level trim to compare yet). As a price of entry, this looks like a bargain. The base V-6 CTS starts at $54,280, the base BMW 535 (a six-cylinder) is $56,845 and the V-6 Audi A6 3.0T is $58,325 with standard all-wheel drive. With all-wheel drive, the XF is still cheaper, at $55,895.\n\nValue isn’t found only in base prices, though. In response to its poor — and certainly earned — reliability reputation, Jaguar recently introduced the most generous warranty coverage in the class, including five-year/60,000-mile basic, powertrain, roadside assistance and telematics collision notification coverage, plus complimentary scheduled maintenance for the same term. Its competitors end basic coverage at four years/50,000, though Cadillac covers powertrains and roadside assistance for six years/70,000. Audi and BMW end their roadside coverage at four years/50,000.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The Enthusiast Special\n\nHang around enough car enthusiasts and you’ll learn many of them have soft spots for wagons, preferably with a manual transmission. And a diesel engine. In other words, the unobtainium of the automotive world. I understand why this kind of car is appealing — good cargo space, fuel efficiency, low-end torque and an engaging driving experience — but it’s not the body style most car shoppers today want.\n\nThe XF Sportbrake, though, has the makings of an enthusiast special, even if it doesn’t check all the boxes. Based on the XF mid-size luxury sedan, the Sportbrake’s body style is sleek and stylish, with a low-slung stance and intimidating face with gaping grilles. It does not, I’m sad to report, offer a manual transmission or a diesel, though Jaguar does champion one or the other in some models including the XF sedan, which offers a diesel engine.\n\nAfter driving the Sportbrake S with its supercharged V-6 engine, however, any longing for a diesel will quickly fade. Rated at 380 horsepower and 332 pounds-feet of torque, the V-6 effortlessly accelerates the wagon up to highway speeds and has the power to quickly pass slower-moving traffic.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic transmission that the engine drives, however, is less impressive; it will leave some driving enthusiasts wishing for a manual. Though the transmission’s part-throttle kickdown performance is exceptional — the automatic drops a gear almost instantly when you press the pedal a bit when cruising — full-throttle kickdowns are drawn-out affairs; the transmission is in no hurry to pick a lower gear.\n\nSimilarly, some aspects of the Sportbrake’s ride and handling performance impressed while others left me underwhelmed. Jaguar has done a good job tuning the car’s suspension, and the ride is taut and controlled in Normal drive mode without feeling harsh, but things are bumpier in the car’s Dynamic mode. The suspension really shines in fast corners; the car feels planted and stays relatively flat, and the bolstered front bucket seats hold you securely in place.\n\nIt’s too bad the wagon’s steering doesn’t provide the same level of enjoyment. The setup is short on road feel in both Normal and Dynamic, and even though it’s easy to place the car where you want, the numb steering is out of step with the wagon’s otherwise sporty demeanor.\n\nWhere’s the Luxury?\n\nThe Sportbrake’s $71,445 starting price (including a $995 destination charge) puts it squarely in competition with luxury cars from the likes of Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, but compared with those offerings, the Jaguar’s interior looks decidedly mainstream — both in overall design and in choice of materials.\n\nThe cabin has a few interesting design cues, such as motorized covers that roll over the outer dashboard air vents, but the layout and appearance is otherwise very plain. There are none of the adventurous, delightful details you get in an E-Class.\n\nBeyond that, many of the materials aren’t rich enough for a car this expensive — or even a car $20,000 less expensive. The basic-looking plastic trim on the center console and below is an eyesore at this price; it’s not any nicer than what you get in Jaguar’s entry-level XE compact luxury car, and the XE’s interior isn’t exceptional for its class.\n\nComfort and Utility\n\nThe driver’s seat’s numerous power adjustments helped me find a comfortable driving position, but it’s one that doesn’t offer great visibility. The raked windshield and large rearview mirror housing work to block your view out the right side of the windshield, making it harder to see crossing traffic at an intersection. The big roof pillar next to the driver’s seat blocks over-shoulder views, and the rear window isn’t big, either. Crisp 360-degree camera system images on the dashboard touchscreen are helpful when maneuvering at low speeds.\n\nThe backseat is comfortable for taller adults, and the seat cushions have a scooped design. The seat folds flat with the cargo floor, increasing cargo volume from 31.7 cubic feet to 69.7, but the backrest doesn’t recline.\n\nWith its low load height and obstruction-free design, the cargo area is a useful space. The only thing that compromises its utility a bit is that it’s not that tall, which might prevent some larger items from fitting.\n\nWhy Here, Why Now?\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Jaguar exclusively sold cars, but the British brand has jumped into the SUV realm in recent years, first with the F-Pace mid-size SUV and then with the compact E-Pace.\n\nWith the popularity of SUVs soaring, those moves make a lot of sense, but with the luxury wagon class barely hanging on, the decision to bring the XF Sportbrake across the Atlantic is harder to understand — especially with a starting price that’s a staggering $22,675 higher than the base XF sedan. There’s no question the Sportbrake is better equipped than the base XF, but its $71,445 starting price will be a deal-breaker for many wagon fans, assuring the car niche status.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2016 about the 2016 XF. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhere the 2015 XF offered a turbocharged four-cylinder, supercharged V-6 and a choice of supercharged V-8s, the 2016 model year starts with only a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. The new entry-level engine, a turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder, will come later in the model year. (See the two model years compared.)\n\nThere are two main XF types: the XF 35t and the XF S. I drove both. The 35t’s engine produces 340 horsepower, while the XF S has 380 hp, functions of different supercharger boost pressure. The 35t comes in Premium, Prestige and R-Sport trim levels, while the XF S stands alone. Both come with an eight-speed automatic transmission and the choice of rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nThe XF competes with the likes of the Audi A6, BMW 535i and Cadillac CTS (see them compared side by side).\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThere wasn’t much wrong with the 2015 Jaguar XF midsize sedan, which might explain the mild, evolutionary approach Jaguar took in redesigning it for 2016. Without a tutor, you probably wouldn’t recognize the differences in exterior styling. The 2016 has lost 0.1 inch in overall length, but the wheelbase is 2 inches longer for more interior space, which helps differentiate the XF from the upcoming XE compact sedan.\n\nThe current trim levels look similar, the primary difference being the S trim’s lack of the metallic-look crossbars that sit over lower trim levels’ outboard air vents in the front bumper. Standard wheels include 18-inch alloys for the Premium trim level, 19s for the middle trims and 20s for the XF S. Xenon headlights are standard; adaptive LED headlights start out optional but are included in the R-Sport and S.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe engine provides plenty of power for quick sprints off the line as well as high-speed passing. The standard eight-speed transmission is reasonably responsive. It’s unfortunate I have to describe it that way, but today’s eight- and nine-speed transmissions frequently exhibit a lot of lag and gear-hunting. The XF’s is better than average. In passing maneuvers, the transmission did a stair-step, two-gear kickdown rather than hopping directly down a couple of gears — but at least it pulled ahead in the brief interim gear rather than bogging down completely. Was the six-speed automatic, which was abandoned in 2013, a better experience? Hell yes, but it was also less efficient.\n\nThe differences between the 340- and 380-hp versions of the engine are so small I don’t think I’d even bother marketing it. The torque ratings are the same — 332 pounds-feet at 4,500 rpm — and both engines hit peak horsepower at 6,500 rpm. Jaguar estimates zero-to-60-mph times of 5.2 and 5.1 seconds with rear-wheel drive, a difference you simply don’t feel in your butt — even if your butt is British.\n\nTurning the rotary-knob gear selector from D to S activates a transmission Sport mode that mitigates the kickdown steps by holding on to lower gears longer. There’s a selectable Dynamic mode — along with Normal, Eco and Winter modes — that activates the transmission’s Sport mode. It also brings more aggressive throttle response, lower power-steering assist and sportier suspension settings with the optional adaptive suspension, which both cars I drove featured. Even better, a configurable menu on the touch-screen lets you select which of these attributes change when you activate Dynamic mode. In some cars, those settings are predetermined at the factory.\n\nThe cabin is pretty quiet. Under heavy acceleration, you hear some nice induction and faint supercharger sounds, but Jaguar could have done more with the exhaust note. I think the company went overboard with the F-Type’s loud exhaust, but even I feel Jaguar went too far in the other direction with the XF. When so many competitors have turbos mucking up their exhaust, the supercharged XF had a lot of potential. Opportunity lost.\n\nWith EPA-estimated mileage of 20/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gas, the 2016 XF beats the base 2015 model by 1 mpg combined and the 2015’s V-6 by 2 mpg combined (rear-drive models). The all-wheel-drive 2016’s 20/28/23 mpg beats the comparable 2015 by 3 mpg combined. The XF is now on par with the competing A6, 535i and CTS.\n\nThe brakes are strong and linear, and the handling is a high point — balanced and neutral, with excellent steering response and feedback I’d describe as above average. The A6 has never been strong in the latter department, and the 5 Series is commonly cited as evidence that BMW has gotten too soft. It’s also gotten too heavy. We won’t know how the XF’s upcoming base model will compare with the 528, but the 35t is 320 pounds lighter than a comparably equipped BMW 535i and 408 pounds less than an Audi A6 3.0T, on which all-wheel drive is standard (the all-wheel-drive Jag is 298 pounds lighter than the Audi). Thanks to more extensive use of aluminum, the rear-drive 2016 XF is 132 pounds lighter than the V-6 2015, and with an all-wheel-drive system that’s a claimed 16 percent lighter, that version of the 2016 is down an impressive 265 pounds. Jaguar’s new all-wheel drive system — as yet untested — is claimed to send 100 percent of torque to the rear wheels unless it’s needed in front.\n\nYou definitely feel the 2016 XF’s lower weight, regardless of your butt’s origin. I wish I could say it’s a revelation, but until I get the car on a racetrack, I’ll call it a welcome attribute in a class that’s largely overweight and overly isolationist.\n\nThough the Continental all-season tires (on 19- and 20-inch wheels) with which my test cars were equipped exhibited admirable grip, it was clear the chassis could handle more. A set of summer performance tires probably would better show the car’s true colors. With the adaptive suspension, the dynamics didn’t come at the expense of ride comfort, even in the sportier setting. The base suspension — which I have yet to drive — has shock absorbers designed to quell high-frequency ripples without sacrificing necessary firmness when needed.\n\nInterior\n\nThe XF’s interior is appropriately luxurious, with real metal and wood trim – though the combination didn’t look right in one of my cars. Fortunately, some of the materials are a la carte options, depending on trim level. And the purple, disco accent lighting on the center console was truly baffling (see the photo to the right). The apparent Bee Gees feature turned out to be the Configurable Interior Mood Lighting option, which, by grace, allows one to select color as well as intensity.\n\nMy cars had the standard simple but clear gauges with a color display between them. In February 2016, Jaguar will offer an optional, reconfigurable all-digital instrument panel measuring 12.3 inches.\n\nAs in most of this class, the XF’s base trim level has imitation leather upholstery and the higher ones have the real thing. (Audi is a notable exception with standard genuine leather.) I remained comfortable in the driver’s seat after hundreds of miles. Front legroom is up almost 3 inches for 2016, to a generous 44.4 inches. Only the CTS beats it, with 45.7 inches. The XF’s front headroom increased 0.4 inch to 37.5 inches, which is a few tenths above the A6 but about 3 inches shy of the 5 Series and CTS. It was high enough for me, at 6 feet tall, to drive with the seat raised almost all the way.\n\nThe addition of rear-quarter windows improves rearward visibility a bit versus the 2015, but the car’s high belt line doesn’t help — typical of today’s cars. A standard backup camera aids in parking maneuvers, as do optional 360-degree cameras and a Park Assist feature that sizes up parking spaces and automatically steers the car in and out of them. Those options are available only on the R-Sport and S trims.\n\nTo me, the single biggest impediment to visibility is the optional heated front windshield, which incorporates squiggly wires that I find distracting in daylight and maddening after dark, when they introduce halos around lights. I don’t know how many ice storms you’d have to encounter yearly to make this tradeoff worthwhile, but as a Chicago resident, I find conventional front defoggers are plenty good enough. Also note that electronic toll transponders usually don’t work through these windshields. Sadly, if you want the optional heated seats and steering wheel, in most cases you’re stuck with the squiggles, too.\n\nBy the numbers, the backseat benefits from the longer wheelbase. With just over a half-inch of additional legroom, the XF’s 37.2 inches is two-tenths of an inch behind the A6 and beats the BMW and Caddy by almost 2 inches. Though the spec is higher, it seems like the seat is closer to the floor than in the 2015, which results in elevated knees. The center floor hump is also very high and wide, which limits the center seat’s usefulness.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nIn keeping with other Jaguars, the new XF’s controls are a combination of buttons and a touch-screen rather than a display with a separate multifunction controller. Starting mid-February 2016, the XF will offer an optional, ambitious InControl Touch Pro multimedia system with a 10.2-inch touch-screen. I tested the standard InControl Touch (“Novice” implied), which has an 8-inch touch-screen flanked by buttons that are mechanical rather than the touch-sensitive panels that cheapen some of Land Rover’s vehicles. Where some Jaguar and Land Rover touch-screens are painfully slow, this base XF system is a newer version that reacts more quickly to touch. It does the job and includes InControl Apps, a smartphone interface for both Android and Apple. Though Jaguar has announced it will adopt Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, they are not currently available.\n\nA navigation system is optional, as is Wi-Fi hot-spot functionality. We can debate how useful an in-car hot spot is, but not that 4G cellular speeds (now the norm) would be better than the XF’s 3G.\n\nThe standard Meridian audio system includes AM and FM radio, USB and analog aux-in jacks and Bluetooth streaming audio with hands-free phone support. Satellite radio (subscription required) is an option. This stereo sounds quite good, so you might be able to live without the optional Meridian surround sound system, which adds over $3,000 — and a CD player.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe XF’s trunk is rated to have a staggering 19.1 cubic feet of cargo volume — more than a cubic foot more than the 2015 and roughly 5 cubic feet more than the Audi, BMW and Cadillac. And it seems that large. It swallowed a couple of roll aboard suitcases and still left the majority of the trunk wide open. The backseat folds in a 40/20/40 split.\n\nInterior storage is less impressive. The glove compartment and door pockets are OK, but there’s room under the center armrest for little more than the audio and 12-volt jacks found there. A phone would make it.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Jaguar XF hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication. Unfortunately, because Jaguar is a relatively low-volume brand, its cars are seldom tested.\n\nIn addition to the usual complement of airbags, the XF offers such active-safety options as forward collision warning with autonomous braking, which operates between 3 and 50 mph and sees cars but not pedestrians (the latter will debut on the Jaguar F-Pace SUV). There’s also lane departure warning and prevention and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. The blind spot warning is uncommonly accurate, seeming to know the definition of a blind spot (not visible in the mirrors); most vehicles trigger an alert when a vehicle is anywhere behind you.\n\nThe XF also excels in the adjustability of some of these features: Lane Keep Assist lets you choose Normal or High Sensitivity, so the feature either corrects egregious wandering out of your lane or essentially steers for you, respectively. The adaptive cruise control, which operates all the way to a stop and can then accelerate again, can be turned off, leaving conventional cruise control. Most vehicles offer only conventional or adaptive cruise.\n\nSee all the XF’s safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nFor 2016, XF prices range from $52,895 to $66,695, including destination fee, representing a $5,275 price decrease from the 2015 V-6 version (there’s no entry-level trim to compare yet). As a price of entry, this looks like a bargain. The base V-6 CTS starts at $54,280, the base BMW 535 (a six-cylinder) is $56,845 and the V-6 Audi A6 3.0T is $58,325 with standard all-wheel drive. With all-wheel drive, the XF is still cheaper, at $55,895.\n\nValue isn’t found only in base prices, though. In response to its poor — and certainly earned — reliability reputation, Jaguar recently introduced the most generous warranty coverage in the class, including five-year/60,000-mile basic, powertrain, roadside assistance and telematics collision notification coverage, plus complimentary scheduled maintenance for the same term. Its competitors end basic coverage at four years/50,000, though Cadillac covers powertrains and roadside assistance for six years/70,000. Audi and BMW end their roadside coverage at four years/50,000.",

      "expert_review": "The Enthusiast Special\n\nHang around enough car enthusiasts and you’ll learn many of them have soft spots for wagons, preferably with a manual transmission. And a diesel engine. In other words, the unobtainium of the automotive world. I understand why this kind of car is appealing — good cargo space, fuel efficiency, low-end torque and an engaging driving experience — but it’s not the body style most car shoppers today want.\n\nThe XF Sportbrake, though, has the makings of an enthusiast special, even if it doesn’t check all the boxes. Based on the XF mid-size luxury sedan, the Sportbrake’s body style is sleek and stylish, with a low-slung stance and intimidating face with gaping grilles. It does not, I’m sad to report, offer a manual transmission or a diesel, though Jaguar does champion one or the other in some models including the XF sedan, which offers a diesel engine.\n\nAfter driving the Sportbrake S with its supercharged V-6 engine, however, any longing for a diesel will quickly fade. Rated at 380 horsepower and 332 pounds-feet of torque, the V-6 effortlessly accelerates the wagon up to highway speeds and has the power to quickly pass slower-moving traffic.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic transmission that the engine drives, however, is less impressive; it will leave some driving enthusiasts wishing for a manual. Though the transmission’s part-throttle kickdown performance is exceptional — the automatic drops a gear almost instantly when you press the pedal a bit when cruising — full-throttle kickdowns are drawn-out affairs; the transmission is in no hurry to pick a lower gear.\n\nSimilarly, some aspects of the Sportbrake’s ride and handling performance impressed while others left me underwhelmed. Jaguar has done a good job tuning the car’s suspension, and the ride is taut and controlled in Normal drive mode without feeling harsh, but things are bumpier in the car’s Dynamic mode. The suspension really shines in fast corners; the car feels planted and stays relatively flat, and the bolstered front bucket seats hold you securely in place.\n\nIt’s too bad the wagon’s steering doesn’t provide the same level of enjoyment. The setup is short on road feel in both Normal and Dynamic, and even though it’s easy to place the car where you want, the numb steering is out of step with the wagon’s otherwise sporty demeanor.\n\nWhere’s the Luxury?\n\nThe Sportbrake’s $71,445 starting price (including a $995 destination charge) puts it squarely in competition with luxury cars from the likes of Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, but compared with those offerings, the Jaguar’s interior looks decidedly mainstream — both in overall design and in choice of materials.\n\nThe cabin has a few interesting design cues, such as motorized covers that roll over the outer dashboard air vents, but the layout and appearance is otherwise very plain. There are none of the adventurous, delightful details you get in an E-Class.\n\nBeyond that, many of the materials aren’t rich enough for a car this expensive — or even a car $20,000 less expensive. The basic-looking plastic trim on the center console and below is an eyesore at this price; it’s not any nicer than what you get in Jaguar’s entry-level XE compact luxury car, and the XE’s interior isn’t exceptional for its class.\n\nComfort and Utility\n\nThe driver’s seat’s numerous power adjustments helped me find a comfortable driving position, but it’s one that doesn’t offer great visibility. The raked windshield and large rearview mirror housing work to block your view out the right side of the windshield, making it harder to see crossing traffic at an intersection. The big roof pillar next to the driver’s seat blocks over-shoulder views, and the rear window isn’t big, either. Crisp 360-degree camera system images on the dashboard touchscreen are helpful when maneuvering at low speeds.\n\nThe backseat is comfortable for taller adults, and the seat cushions have a scooped design. The seat folds flat with the cargo floor, increasing cargo volume from 31.7 cubic feet to 69.7, but the backrest doesn’t recline.\n\nWith its low load height and obstruction-free design, the cargo area is a useful space. The only thing that compromises its utility a bit is that it’s not that tall, which might prevent some larger items from fitting.\n\nWhy Here, Why Now?\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Jaguar exclusively sold cars, but the British brand has jumped into the SUV realm in recent years, first with the F-Pace mid-size SUV and then with the compact E-Pace.\n\nWith the popularity of SUVs soaring, those moves make a lot of sense, but with the luxury wagon class barely hanging on, the decision to bring the XF Sportbrake across the Atlantic is harder to understand — especially with a starting price that’s a staggering $22,675 higher than the base XF sedan. There’s no question the Sportbrake is better equipped than the base XF, but its $71,445 starting price will be a deal-breaker for many wagon fans, assuring the car niche status.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
