      "expert_review": "The 2006 Jaguar XJ Super V8 is a car to be seen in, preferably in the backseat rather than the driver’s seat. Driving my children around in such an upscale mode of transportation (“car” just doesn’t do the deed to describe a vehicle that costs more than $90,000) has me mistaking even myself for the new family chauffeur. The scary thing is that it’s not such a stretch of the imagination: This is the grim reality of motherhood.\n\nI have to admit to some slight jealously due to the fact that my kids were living the good life in the back of the Super V8. With fold-down picnic/business trays behind each of the front seats, their hopes were high for independent living. If only I hadn’t spoiled all their fun by not letting them picnic in the car, life would be good. Sorry, crayons and markers are out of the question, too. Shoes? Nope, take them off before entering the house – I mean car. As a matter of fact, I should make them wear plastic abatement suits to protect the vehicle’s ivory leather seats from the general kid-ness that follows most children (even clean ones) wherever they go.\n\nIndependent video screens for each child also got their hopes up. The biggest trick was figuring out how to work them. After 10 minutes of finagling, I finally broke down and read the owner’s manual to discover that DVDs are loaded in the trunk. Hmm, that’s convenient! I guess people with chauffeurs aren’t concerned about functionality – they can just have someone else (like mom) change the movies when needed. The rear video system, audio system and climate controls can each be operated independently from the front.\n\nDespite the fact that most people wouldn’t consider the Super V8 family-friendly, car seats and booster seats are surprisingly easy to install. The exception was the bump on my noggin I sustained ducking under the door jam (and not quite succeeding) when buckling in the baby of the family. My eldest, in a booster seat, had no trouble fastening her own seat belt thanks to easy-to-use buckles.\n\nAlthough the back seat is a very pleasant place to be in this car, the driver’s seat isn’t bad, either. Equipped with systems such as park assist (an audible tone telling me how far the front and rear of the vehicle is from parking obstacles), automatic speed limiter (not allowing the driver to accelerate above a pre-set speed limit) and adaptive cruise control (using radar sensors to keep the vehicle a set distance from the car in front), the Super V8 nearly drives itself. The Jaguar voice command system also pitches in to help limit driver distractions, such as fiddling with radio controls. Adjustable pedals and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel combine with infinitely adjustable front seats to help every driver find a perfect fit.\n\nDespite all the extras, I’m still trying to figure out what makes this vehicle’s price soar to and surpass $90,000. Where are the heated and cooled cupholders? Where are the air-cooled seats? Maybe it’s the 400-horsepower supercharged V-8 engine (which surprisingly enough gets fairly good gas mileage), the lambswool rugs, the hand-inlaid boxwood and burl walnut veneer trim or the ambla-trimmed fascia (don’t ask me what that is). Or maybe some things are simply worth what others are willing to pay for them. In the case of the Jaguar Super V8, $90,000 might just be the price to pay to turn heads and look the part. You want me to play the part for a week or two? Well, OK, if you twist my arm.\n\n*For more information on the Jaguar Super V8 and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Take a seat in an electrically adjustable lounge chair. Fold down the richly buffed picnic tray and, if you choose, watch whatever is on the screen built into the back of the leather lounge chair in front of your seat.\n\nDid I mention that we’ll be traveling from 0-60 miles per hour in five seconds?\n\nBut don’t worry, all will be smooth, quiet, and elegant inside the 2007 Jaguar XJ Super V8.\n\nThere is a remarkable market out there for super luxury sedans like this one. They feature horsepower approaching or topping 400, expensive leathers, finely polished woods, jet-like launches, and Autobahn-worthy top ends.\n\nI have long held to the “it’s not what’s on the outside that counts” philosophy, and so should Jaguar with this rendition of its high-class sedan. That’s because the outside does nothing to advance the Jaguar brand into bolder markets occupied by competitors like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi. Sure, the grille has a nice mesh weave and its longer wheelbase sets it apart from others in the XJ lineup. But it’s a look that will appeal to a dwindling band of loyalists, not potential new buyers. Under the skin — from the power plant to interior amenities — this car is in a class with all of the above models.\n\nThe 4.2-liter V-8 engine is supercharged and intercooled to the romp of 400 horsepower and 413 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nIt provides a launch that could be problematic in a rear-wheel-drive car without standard stability control. You can still chirp the tires, induce a bit of rear-end wiggle, but it won’t let you get into trouble.\n\nAt higher speeds it cruises virtually silently (laminated side glass with acoustic layers helps). Kick it in to pass, however, and there is the subtle screech of the supercharger sucking air. It is accompanied by a bottomless pit of torque that rockets the car into the passing lane, past whatever it is you want to place in your rear view mirror, and quickly back into the travel lane so as not to be overexposed to roadside radar.\n\nThe six-speed automatic transmission is transparent. Put it in drive and let the car do the rest. Or, if you want to play in manual mode, a Bosch Mechatronic lets you take over.\n\nIndependent suspension front and rear is quietly aided by self-leveling air springs. Sport and comfort settings are available through a button on the center console. If I have a complaint, it is that I did not find the sport mode stiff enough. There ought to be a bigger gap between the two, with sport winning out.\n\nBrakes are antilock with boost assist, and rely on 13.98-inch discs up front and 12.83-inch brakes in the rear. The body is an aluminum monocoque with magnesium crossbeam and steel subframe support.\n\nIt does not drive like a heavy car, and that leaves driver and occupant wrapped in what feels like a light lap of luxury.\n\nWhen you look at a leather dash and see that its seams are double-stitched, you know you’re not in just any car. The piped leather seats are firm and supple at the same time, automatically adjustable front and rear (16 ways for the driver), and heated. Rear seats are individual buckets.\n\nAt your feet are lambs wool rugs. The interior appointments feature walnut burl veneers that gleam with luxury.\n\nFour-zone climate control is standard as is DVD navigation, rear DVD entertainment screens, a 12-speaker Alpine sound system, Bluetooth technology for mobile phones, folding picnic trays, and MP3 connections.\n\nStandard safety features appropriately include dynamic stability control, ABS, tire pressure monitoring, driver and passenger front and side air bags, and front and rear side curtain air bags. Even the rich need protection.\n\nBut the rich can afford face- lifts, and the Jaguar sedan lineup needs one. While I believe that beauty is on the inside when it comes to people, I also hold that it does not necessarily apply to cars.\n\nFortunately, Jag execs say, the exteriors of the next wave of sedans will bear more resemblance to the gorgeous XKR sports car we reviewed recently than this stodgy XJ Super V8.",
