      "expert_review": "Little things mean a lot.\n\nIn the fiercely competitive luxury car market, automakers must keep themselves attuned to the finest details, for in this league the buyers are especially discerning. Two cars see minor changes that make for a big difference in their make-up. The Mercedes Benz E-Class gets an 8-cylinder option, while Jaguar’s XJ6 gets a long-wheelbase version of its venerable sedan platform. Here’s a look at two posh motorcars.\n\nWith sheet metal as stylish as that of the mid-sized Mercedes E-Class, you wonder why they need to advertise at all. The front is sensuously shaped, with fenders that bulge into the hood over the round head lamps. The grille plays counterpoint to the massive lights, with fine horizontal chrome bands, crossed by a singular horizontal bar that intersects with the famed three-pointed star. The look is arrestingly elegant and fresh.\n\nWhat’s under the hood is especially fresh. Although the E320 is powered by a 217-horsepower 3.2-litre six-cylinder engine, the E420 sports a double-overhead-cam aluminum V8 engine. With 275 horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of torque, this engine squirts to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds. And unlike some past Mercedes engines, this one has good power down low. It builds strongly as the speed climbs to extra-legal velocity. There’s a slight commotion to keep you informed of what’s going on.\n\nIf there’s anything that’s disappointing, it’s the light feel of this car. Unlike previous E sedans, this one doesn’t have that bank-vault solidness at speed. Where you once felt a hunkered-down feeling at speed, this car answers back with a light, delicate feel that’s more Asian than German. Some might find this a radical change in character.\n\nThat’s not to say this car handles poorly. Quite the contrary. It handles roads with grace and poise, delivering the typical firm but not punishing ride. But that extra quotient of character that’s been a hallmark of Mercedes handling ismissing. Yet it’s still available in the line’s other cars.\n\nSafety is still of top concern to Mercedes. For 1997, all Mercedes, including the E-Class, have a front-seat-occupancy detection sensor. If a child of 26 pounds or less sits in the front seat, a sensor deactivates the passenger side air bag. Also standard is traction control, anti-lock brakes and door-mounted side air bags.\n\nInside, all occupants are treated to the fine seating that ensures hours of travel without back pain, despite a seat cushion that was firm and unyielding.\n\nThe center console is decorated with a finely polished wood. The controls are simply set, yet their function takes some learning. The dual climate control is much easier to use than previous units. Other luxury amenities include memory seating positions, built-in garage door opener and a Bose sound system specifically designed for the E-Class.\n\nThe base price for this heavy dose of Germanic civility is $49,990, with the test ve hicle’s bottom line fetching $52,450.\n\nWith the current E-Class, Mercedes marks a change in attitude, one that marches to style as well as substance.\n\nEven though the British have handed over Hong Kong to the Chinese and the sun has finally set on the Empire, there are still remainders of greatness. One of these is the Jaguar XJ6L.\n\nWhat Jaguar has wrought is a sedan fit for a king and his corgis. With a 5-inch stretch in wheelbase, the car boasts more rear legroom and better headroom than the regular XJ6. With a length just over 202 inches, this car is no midget. But it still manages to look long and lean, with a sporting stance that’s rare for cars in this class. Motivating this fine car is an inline, double-overhead-cam, aluminum 6-cylinder engine that produces 245 horsepower at 4,800 rpm and 289 pound feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Powered through a four-speed automatic transmission with normal and sport modes, this car moves out with a subdued growl quicker th n you can say, “Hail Britannia.”\n\nJags are famous for their adept balance of luxury and agility, and this car is no exception. The steering has power assist, yet never feels numb, with good information telegraphed about what the wheels are doing. There is no body lean in corners and stops are short and swift.\n\nInside, it’s the usual fine leathers and acres of polished wood. Somehow, it looks a lot more natural here than in almost any other competitor, with a finesse that screams refinement. Also unchanged are the fussy controls that flank the Jag’s steering wheel. Once you get used to them, you’ll enjoy how they work, but be sure to read the owner’s manual first.\n\nThe long wheelbase helps this car immensely, endowing it with a spacious feel that resembles a rolling palace on wheels.\n\nBut these British cars have always had a reputation for being somewhat unreliable. Thanks to Ford’s ownership over the last four years, the quality problems seem to have been greatly diminished to the point that you now use the words quality and Jaguar in the same sentence without being laughed at. The last XJ6 I drove (sometime in 1990) seemed junky and overpriced. It rattled and left me wondering who would buy one. This one was solid and well-built, leaving me lusting after the mere thought of owning one.\n\nBut owning one means saving your shekels. The regular XJ6 starts at $54,400. The long wheelbase commands $59,500. The test vehicles options included a $350 convenience package (integrated garage door opener, three-position memory system and electrochromatic mirror) and a $2,000 All-Weather Package (traction control, heated front and rear seats). The engine requires premium fuel at a rate of 17 mpg city, 23 mpg highway. Test mileage was 16 mpg.\n\nLittle changes, big difference in cars. While Mercedes tries to add stylish to its list of attributes of strength and speed, Jaguar adds solid to its list of attributes, which includes stylish.Either will make your heart swoon. But at this price, that’s a given.",

      "expert_review": "Jaguar cars have gone from standing joke to sitting comfortably at the feet of Cadillac and Lexus in surveys of the reliable and satisfying.\n\nAnd these were the spit-and-spackle cars, cobbled by new parent Ford, who prayed dignity and genealogy would sustain sales while Anglo-American management treated Jaguar’s primary infections: Dickensian production facilities, a joyless work force and vehicles that usually died shortly after being born.\n\nFord is now five years into its $3-billion purchase and equally expensive rewhelping of Jaguar.\n\nBehind the British scenes, leaner assembly teams are working with motivated supervisors in a more modern plant of aerospace cleanliness. The primary passions were quality, productivity and revising international perceptions. Customer expectations had become management’s mantra.\n\nIn American showrooms, those transitional cars of the early ’90s–aided by relentless attention to reliability, price reductions, honest admission of yesterday’s warts and unprecedented cash-back guarantees–have not only stalled Jaguar’s descent but brought the British company clawing back.\n\nJaguar even has its nose under the tent flap of J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction rankings.\n\nNow the 1995 XJ sedans, the first all-Ford Jaguars, are here.\n\nAnd they are bloody wonderful. Ford, blessedly, has not meddled with Jaguar’s good and traditional things: that wonderfully secure ride and elegant surroundings suggesting tea at the Savoy.\n\nThe leaping kitty is back as a hood ornament, albeit a $200 option to a dull, flat badge. Leather seats still fit like chamois Windbreakers, and an aristocratic, semi-sporting ride promises there will always be a Jaguar. Also that someone up there at Ford appreciates the inner soul of this big cat and considers it sacrosanct.\n\nStyling, maybe the first area where one would expect visible Americanization, only recovers and enhances the car’s heritage. Although all body panels are new and more than 2,000 components fresh or retooled, the XJ’s hunkering silhouette remains largely unchanged–with the distinctive retrospective of four circular headlights, plus eyebrows, that first winked at us from the Series III Jaguars of the early ’80s.\n\nGone are irritations that emerged in 1957 with the Mk VIII sedans and made owning a Jaguar more painful addiction than daily pleasure. And to remove risks from writing that sweeping conclusion of dependability, we thrashed several new Jaguars over a period of three months, on far, lonely roads and at Willow Springs International Raceway.\n\nNothing broke, leaked, cracked or even creaked. The electricals–Jaguar’s albatross and systems that usually suffered more burnouts than Edison’s first light bulbs–held firm. No piece of trim, knob or cover worked loose or fell off.\n\nFor the first time from many Jaguar litters, the 1995 cars inspire confidence that every turn of the key, each touch of latch or switch will produce the designed response. Every time.\n\nThe new luxury lineup starts with the XJ6 in base form and the more statuesque Vanden Plas. Prices are up about $2,000 from last year, with the XJ6 selling for $53,450 and the Vanden Plas costing $62,200. Both are powered by a 4.0-liter straight six with a new cylinder head and block, redesigned camshafts, more sophisticated engine computers and a 10% power increase to245 horsepower.\n\nThe flagship XJ12 costs a heart-stopping $77,000 and is given the 6.0-liter, V-12 engine producing 313 horsepower. For the hot and red blooded, there’s the XJR at $65,000 with a supercharger blowing into the inline six engine. It develops 322 horsepower, a top speed of 155 m.p.h. and many questions about the wisdom of paying $12,000 more for the V-12.\n\nSo much about the XJ6 is fresh, very welcome and designed to coddle driver and passengers during long and rapid touring.\n\nThere’s a new tr ction control system to adjust brakes and throttle when wheels lose their grip. Also 12-position power seats with memories, telescopic and tilt steering wheel, and that most useful of Detroit touches: an overhead console with cubbies for sunglasses and garage-door opener.\n\nIf there was one really awful trait of past Jaguars, it was stiff, piggy handling. They were never a match for competition that included the sweet and nimble BMW 5-Series, Lexus 400, Cadillac STS and Mercedes-Benz E320.\n\nIn a hurry on twisty roads, the British entry was a field trip in the bad physics of top-heavy weight transference.\n\nThe ride is still not ideal for running cones and hairpin turns. But there are quicker, highly accurate responses to steering input. Thanks to revised front suspension geometry and stiffer shocks, the new cars sit flatter when changing direction.\n\nFrom leather dash and a J-gate shifter–with the short side still allowing down-shifting and engine-braking–the outlines of the interior are only lightly resculptured, a little more modern. Yet just as familiar and comfortable.\n\nHead and leg room have been stretched a smidgen or two, but all that does is transform the cabin from tight to cozy, with a roof level that is a hair-ruffler for the vertically endowed, front and back.\n\nIf there is one large and inexplicable botch, it is the absence of a glove box. That dashboard space is eaten by a passenger-side air bag. Yet most cars in this luxury sedan class manage to offer both.\n\nWe are left to presume that Ford decided a Jaguar without quirks is a Jaguar without character.\n\nThere is a sense to driving a Jaguar with its solid talent for high-speed cruising that is as distinctive as the heavy gait of a Mercedes, or the eiderdown ride of a Lincoln.\n\nIt’s a velvet surge. There’s this whoosh of high performance as a six-cylinder engine with a direct bloodline to the XK-120, Stirling Moss and D-Types propels a two-ton sedan like a two-place roadster. And about as quickly.\n\nIt’s all done in smooth, silent style. It allows dignified, impressive passing, much the way royalty moves through a crowd. Such travel also happens to be friendly and enormously entertaining.\n\nOr yet another subtle reverence of Jaguar.\n\n1995 Jaguar XJ6\n\nPrice: $53,450\n\nThe Good: Well crafted and mechanically reliable at last. Perfect blend of heritage and technology. A V-6 that hauls like a V-8. Will be high style a decade from now\n\nThe Bad: Snug insides. Smallish trunk. No glove box.\n\nThe Ugly: When was the last time a manufacturer charged extra for a hood ornament?\n\nCost As tested, $58,060. (Includes dual air bags, four-speed automatic, Conolly leather and walnut interior, power seats, security system, air conditioning, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, CD changer–and that $200 “bonnet leaper.”)\n\nEngi ne 4.0-liter, 24-valve, inline-six developing 245 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, rear-drive, luxury performance sedan.\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, 8.5 seconds. Top speed, manufacturer tested, 140 m.p.h. Fuel consumption, EPA city and highway, 17 and 23 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 4,020 pounds.",
