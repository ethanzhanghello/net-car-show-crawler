      "expert_review": "Jaguar convertible.\n\nThe words are magic.\n\nAll you have to do is say them and suddenly you wield incredible influence. For example:\n\nCasual acquaintances and so-called friends drop by unexpectedly feigning a sort of nonchalant interest in your well-being.\n\nCo-workers drop what they are doing in a moment’s notice to assist you.\n\nFamily members invite you for dinner.\n\nYou can get a date.\n\nOK, so I am exaggerating just a little.\n\nBut you do get noticed in a Jaguar convertible.\n\nThe fluid, graceful physique of the XJS makes other luxury convertibles seem irrelevant.\n\nAnd the car’s seductive shape is enough to make you forgive it for having both an automatic transmission and an air conditioning compressor of late 1960s vintage.\n\nRegardless of the antiquity of some of its mechanical parts, Jaguar’s XJS convertible is a mobile masterpiece.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe XJS convertible is powered by a 5.3-liter aluminum V-12 engine that develops a silky-smooth 263 horsepower. There is only one gearbox available, a General Motors Turbo 400 three-speed automatic.\n\nThis drivetrain delivers what seems like sedate performance, but 0-to-60 mph comes up in a shade under 10 seconds. It also delivers reasonable fuel economy, about 15 miles per gallon in the city and 19 mpg on the highway.\n\nI found the XJS to be at its best at higher speeds. It feels downright muscular accelerating from 50 mph to 65 mph. Because it settles into a cruising mode so quietly, you have to strain to hear the engine.\n\nThe V-12 – the only one available in a convertible – develops most of its power after 4,000 rpm. It can be safely revved to 6,700 rpm.\n\nBut the American version of the XJS does not take kindly to aggressive driving because it is a grand touring machine, not a sports car.\n\nIn Great Britain, the XJS is an entirely different cat. It is, in fact, something of a hot rod. Over there, the hardtop model can be outfitted with a 223-horsepower 4.0-liter 24-valve six cylinder and five-speed manual transmission. That car also features a stiffer, more agile suspension.\n\nIt’s a shame the British version isn’t offered here.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe four-wheel independent suspension under the XJS has a formidable task managing the road manners of a car that weighs better than 2 tons – 4,194 pounds, to be exact.\n\nThe ride is very soft, almost bouncy through dips and over large bumps. Yet, over speed bumps and other minor nuisances, the suspension system absorbs the trauma without telegraphing the ruckus to the driver.\n\nThanks in part to the car’s fat tires and wide stance, you can blast quickly through curves in the XJS, but it takes a little extra work to keep things under control.\n\nThe extra-sturdy body makes the XJS very stiff. There is no cowl shake, a flexing near the base of the windshield when driven on bumpy roads. Cowl shake is common in many convertibles.\n\nThe ride is very quiet. With th e top up and radio off, I took the XJS over a rough stretch of asphalt on Lee Road in Winter Park. Of all the cars I have taken there this year, none has done a better job filtering out road noise.\n\nStandard equipment includes anti-lock power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes and power-assisted rack and pinion steering.\n\nBoth systems seem well-matched to the XJS’s grand touring intentions.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nAlmost everyone who persuaded me to give them a ride in the XJS commented on the wonderfully aromatic smell of the leather interior. Indeed, the pungent smell of the English Connolly leather seats was nearly intoxicating.\n\nThis year Jaguar redesigned the XJS. Most of the exterior body panels are new, but chances are you might not notice because the car looks pretty much the same as it always has.\n\nThe difference is this: Jaguar has reduced the number of parts by making more one-piece body panels. The rear fenders, for example, are now each made of a si gle pressing, rather than the five used in previous models. The result is a stiffer, quieter, better-built car.\n\nWith the sumptuous cloth top raised and windows closed, the XJS is as quiet as a tomb. The power top, by the way, can be lowered in a matter of seconds without the driver ever having to leave his or her seat.\n\nThe analog gauges are similar to the classic Smiths instruments used for years in older Jaguars. They look like something made by a Swiss watchmaker.\n\nThe power seats are firm and comfortable on long trips, and they have a computerized memory that automatically sets the seats for two drivers.\n\nPleasing, relaxed, quiet and comfortable are just a few of the words you can attach to the latest version of the XJS.",

      "expert_review": "How bad did it get?\n\nJaguar executives remember 1988 as the year product reliability went bonkers. Engine assembly and quality controls were so sloppy that variances among factory-fresh, in-line sixes wavered by as much as 40 horsepower. Or 18% of potential power.\n\nHow good is it getting?\n\nTighter manufacturing methods, reports Mike Dale, president of Jaguar Cars Inc., have resulted in significant improvements in the marque’s quality over the last 18 months. “You know,” he says with a sly smile, “I just can’t get used to how the chrome lines up straight.”\n\nWhich leaves only the question of how Jaguar managed this apparent return from the brink of extinction to the cusp of a better future.\n\nRecovery began three years ago when Ford Motor Co. of Dearborn, Mich., purchased Jaguar Cars Ltd. of Coventry, England, for $3.5 billion.\n\nThat bought a grand history, a terrible reputation and a very dodgy future. Many believe the price should have included the BBC, most of the Cotswolds and unlimited time-sharing at Windsor Castle.\n\nUndaunted, Ford began the enormous task of putting claws back into Jaguar. Its lone caveat was signal: A luxury Jaguar is a British tradition, a world distinction that must never be recycled as an American Ford styled for the masses.\n\nExecutive changes were made with desks for anyone dedicated to ruthless quality management. A top-heavy work force was trimmed from 12,000 employees to 7,000. Productivity was pushed, design processes and manufacturing methods polished, machinery that looked like Industrial Revolution leftovers junked–and union featherbedding defeated.\n\n“Employees had been working to a quota system–say the production of 30 ‘whatchits’ a shift,” explains Jaguar spokesman John Crawford. “Any employee who had made his 30 ‘whatchits’ by 11:30 a.m. was then allowed to sit around and do nothing all day.”\n\nThe new, improved, transitional, yet not visibly changed Jaguars have been selling in the United States for almost two years.\n\nIn that period, the car has gone from 25th to 10th place in a J. D. Power survey measuring customer satisfaction, including buyer impressions of vehicle reliability.\n\nAt assembly line levels, Crawford adds, faults per 100 cars have dropped by 80%. Warranty claims are down.\n\nNow Jaguars representing all manufacturing changes by Ford–36 months of revisions touching 1,500 components per car–are here.\n\nAnd this year’s radical conversion of the prowling, low-heeled, thoroughly seductive 1993 Jaguar XJS is typical of the bold thinking and tough execution by which Jaguar hopes to bury its past.\n\nGone is the aristocratic but excessive V-12 engine that for two decades has powered 52,000 coupe and convertible versions of the XJS. In its place is the lighter, thriftier and politically cooler in-line six with 4.0 liters gathering 223 horsepower.\n\nHalf the cylinder count cert ainly saps a little of the elitism that the XJS has always shared with the Mercedes 600SL convertible, BMW’s 850i coupe and others in the V-12 club. But that’s a shallow loss at best.\n\nFor a smaller engine makes for a more agile, better balanced car. Minus six cylinders and 200 pounds of engine metal, the new XJS gets off the line a smidge faster than the previous guard and seems just as athletic in higher acceleration ranges. It most certainly is easier on premium unleaded.\n\nBut here’s the marketing masterstroke. By virtue of its inexpensive transplant, the 1993 XJS Coupe is selling for a whopping $10,000 less than the V-12 version.\n\nAnd at $49,750, this elegant, fully optioned Jaguar is now comfortably closer in price, and therefore buyer appeal, to the big luxury sedans from Lexus and Infiniti and comparable grand tourers from Mercedes.\n\nThe flowing, long-nosed exterior of the XJS is unaltered, but for the absence of a V-12 emblem on the rear vala ce. That does not represent resistance to change. It means there has been no public pressure to revise what is considered the handsomest Jaguar since the XK-120 two-seaters of 1948.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is this year’s optional companion to an electronically enhanced four-speed automatic.\n\nExcept for CD player and seat warmers, there are few luxuries that aren’t standard on the long, low and lovely XJS twins. Their inventory includes driver’s-side air bag, full Connolly leather interior, power seats with memories, anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control, alarm, fog lamps, trip computer and very much etcetera.\n\nBody paint is rich, deep and in the brighter colors, glossy enough for toy soldiers. New electricals fed by a 120-amp Nippondenso alternator replace old wiring that before Ford’s purchase was a recurring bad joke alongside Dan Quayle and Bakersfield. The XJS also wears enough burl walnut to panel a stateroom aboard QEII.\n\nBut what of reliability, the arrant demon that at times left more Jaguars than beer cans littering roadsides from Seattle to John o’Groats?\n\nFinal resolution can come only from months spent driving a hundred cars for several million miles across the real world.\n\nBut after thrashing two XJS coupes–one automatic, the other a five-speed manual–for two weeks and close to 1,500 miles through gales, snow, coastal fog and desert sun, the sum total of problems mechanical, structural and electrical was: Zero.\n\nBetter yet, each car felt tight and maintained a sense of remaining bolted together longer than its warranties. Trim and panels stayed glued and held fast no matter road ruts and humidity. Doors, trunk and hood lids operated easily, solidly without hanging up or being shoved to fit.\n\nDespite that pint-sized motor in a 10-gallon engine bay, the XJS cat roars as always; tracking flat and firm on fat paws by Goodyear and quite capable of extended 100 m.p.h. cruising without breathing deeply.\n\nYet the XJS remains very British and particularly Jaguar-ish, which is noticeably anachronistic. That includes swivel-lidded ashtrays and a placard warning not to touch plug leads “whilst the engine is running.”\n\nSo view it as a heavy, sedate vehicle much happier on broad expressways and muscling through long, sweeping turns than playing heel-and-toe hopscotch on serpentine country lanes. The XJS simply is too long, too weighty on the steering, too deliberate in its responses for nimble stuff in jumbled traffic.\n\nDon’t look for cup holders in any Jag-wah. The British believe their Jag-ewers and motorways are for motoring. Tea is taken at Fortnum & Mason.\n\nThe XJS coupe contains two perfectly upholstered and miniaturized rear seats. They are useless for anything that can’t be folded, squashed or tossed.\n\nThere is no surplus front head room in the coupe for those 6 feet tall and beyond. It also is time Jaguar redesi gned the heft of its automatic shifter. A little more girth, weight and grip would lessen its feel as a T-handled chopstick.\n\nAlthough Jaguar sales remain a crapshoot, recent numbers show significant improvements. In December, 1991, Jaguar sold only 693 cars in the United States. Last December, the total rose to 1,072.\n\nJaguar-Ford has budgeted $120 million for the next phase of its expanding future. It includes the December launch of a V-12-engined flagship, a high-performance luxury sedan, the XJR-S.\n\nThere will be a newV-8 engine followed by a smaller, more affordable Jaguar.\n\nAnd in an obvious desire to leave no customer request unserviced, Jaguar will indeed install cup holders in 1994.\n\nPlans are even being made to ditch the car’s flat-faced feline badge and bring back the leaping cat as a hood ornament.\n\nMeanwhile, American fortunes of Jaguar–which account for 40% of company sales–teeter precariously on the whiskery, seemingly ine adicable issue of reliability.\n\nTo prove its own faith in the new cars, Jaguar recently offered unprecedented guarantees on cars sold in selected test markets : a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all 1993 cars.\n\nTo date, 400 Jaguars have been sold in those centers. Only four have been returned. One customer’s financing didn’t clear. Two buyers returned coupes to trade on sedans. And one woman decided she really preferred a Mercedes.\n\n“Not one return involved mechanical problems,” notes Crawford. “We are quite impressed.”\n\n1993 Jaguar XJS Coupe\n\nThe Good Quality, reliability measurably improved. Base price slashed by more than $10,000. Lighter, smaller, more efficient engine. Still good-looking lap of traditional luxury for royals and rock stars.\n\nThe Bad Skimpy head room, no rear seat room. A little heavy in the handling.\n\nThe Ugly Skimpy, out-of-context gearshift.\n\nCost Base: $49,750.

      "expert_review": "Time is running out for a very special Jaguar.\n\nAlthough the XJS grand touring coupe and convertible will be back for the 1995 model year, neither car will be available with a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nThat’s how this week’s test car came equipped. And let me tell you something: If you yearn for the days when Jaguar built real sports cars – cats that would leap from 0 to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds – you might want to hustle down to your local Jaguar dealer and see what the XJS with its German built five-speed can do.\n\nLike me, you might be shocked.\n\nThe XJS always has been an exceptionally smooth and somewhat-quick grand touring machine. But a souped-up Camaro or Mustang could easily leave it at a stoplight.\n\nWith the five-speed, you can wind up the Jag’s race-proven engine and unleash the big cat’s full performance potential. Not many cars will be able to out-accelerate the XJS five-speed.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nJaguar claims that the 1994 models are ”the best Jaguars ever built.” This is no empty sales pitch. For each of the past three years, Jaguar has made dramatic gains in quality. True, Jaguar had a lot of ground to make up, but bankrolled by parent company Ford Motor Co., Jaguar now has the resources to build-high quality automobiles. And based on this week’s test car, that’s exactly what the British automaker is doing.\n\nThe 24-valve straight-six engine in the XJS convertible idles so smoothly that you would swear it isn’t running at all. Lexus has nothing on Jaguar in this area.\n\nOf all the Jaguars I’ve driven over the years, this week’s test car felt the most solid – and trustworthy.\n\nI drove the car hard nearly every time I got behind the wheel.\n\nThe 4.0-liter, 219-horsepower aluminum engine can take one heck of beating. Many times I wound up the silky-smooth engine close to the red line on the tachometer. Never once did the car miss a beat, nor did the temperature or oil pressure gauges come anywhere close to veering into their danger zones.\n\nYou can’t say that about older Jags, which were known to overheat, stall and suffer catastrophic failures for no apparent reason.\n\nThose days are gone.\n\nWhat makes this week’s XJS special is its manual transmission. Jaguar officials thought a stick shift would appeal to ”enthusiast” drivers. And although the German-built five-speed Getrag gearbox does transform the car, many buyers apparently feel that they shouldn’t have to manually shift a $60,000 automobile.\n\nJaguar officials say only about 100 customers in the United States have bought an XJS with the stick shift and that the option will be dropped by the end of the 1994 model year.\n\nHaving driven all versions of the XJS (the six-cylinder also comes with an automatic transmission, and there’s a 12-cylinderengine with an automatic), there’s no doubt in my mind that this week’s test car is the one I would most want to own. Performance-minded drivers will fi nd that it is by far the most fun and enjoyable version to drive.\n\nThe clutch is firm, tight and fast, but with a positive feel. It doesn’t take long to get used to the pedal and learn how to shift quickly. The shifter slips smoothly and easily into each gear.\n\nBecause the engine pulls so strongly and revs to 6,000 rpm, you find that you don’t have to shift as often as you might expect.\n\nDespite my heavy foot, fuel mileage was excellent. The test car delivered 18 mpg in the city and 24 on the highway. Not bad for a car that weighs more than 2 tons.\n\nHANDLING\n\nOur test car came with Jaguar’s optional ”sports pack” suspension system, which includes fat 16-inch Pirelli tires mounted on special wheels, high-performance shocks, a front anti-roll bar and stiffer springs.\n\nThe XJS feels as if it is connected to the road the same way a roller coaster is connected to its tracks.\n\nNo matter how hard I tossed the XJS into a curve the body always stayed oised and the tires never once lost their grip. The XJS is a fairly wide car, an d I think that, along with some extraordinary fine-tuning of the suspension system, is the secret to the Jaguar’s lithe and agile road manners.\n\nThe power-assisted steering is a little too light for my liking, but it is quick and, because it takes so little effort to turn the wheel, it makes the car seem that much more responsive.\n\nThe four-wheel power-assisted disc brakes are the best I can remember on a Jaguar. Touch the pedal and they bite hard, slowing the car quickly and without fuss.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nI have no complaints with the way the XJS is assembled. Parts are fitted much better by Jaguar than they used to be.\n\nHowever, there are areas where the XJS is really showing its advanced age. The XJS, in production since 1975, has been improved over the years, but the overall design of the interior still feels as if it belongs in the mid-70s, not the mid-90s.\n\nErgonomically, the XJS is something of a mess. You can get reasonably comfortable in the car, but in no way will the XJS coddle you in the same manner as, say, a Lexus SC 400 sport coupe.\n\nThe tilt steering wheel is too close to the edge of the driver’s seat – making getting in and out a tight squeeze. When raised, the wheel obscures the instruments.\n\nBecause the front and rear seats actually touch, there is absolutely no legroom in the rear for passengers. In all likelihood, Jaguar added the rear seat so that the XJS convertible would be classified as a four-seater, thereby qualifying for lower insurance premiums.\n\nInsurance companies tend to charge a premium for two-seat sports cars. The rear area must be viewed only as a place to store small items.\n\nThe electrically adjustable front seats, covered with tan leather, were quite comfortable, but a bit narrow. Those with a large derriere might find the XJS a tight fit.\n\nThe center console, though beautifully trimmed in wood, is home to numerous switches and buttons. The electric door locks clunk loudly.\n\nAnd yet from the outside, our British Racing Green test car with its tan cloth convertible top was simply gorgeous.\n\nRaising and lowering that top can be done with the flick of a button.\n\nThe car is quiet, top up or down, and visibility is good.\n\nThis year, the XJS has both a driver’s and passenger’s air bag.\n\nDespite having to make compromises inside, the XJS – especially with the stick shift -is a very rewarding vehicle to drive.\n\nTruett’s tip: The XJS convertible, when equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, is fast and mean. And like fine wine, the XJS just keeps getting better with age.",
