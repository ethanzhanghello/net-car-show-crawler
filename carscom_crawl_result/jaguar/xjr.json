      "expert_review": "You have to wonder if you’re getting effete when you send back an $80,000 car – kind of like refusing a $400 bottle of wine . . .\n\nWell, okay, they repossessed it – but I wasn’t all that unhappy to see it go.\n\nThe flagship Jaguar, despite its many enticements, is neither as much fun to drive or as posh (to borrow a Briticism) as the comparable offerings from Asia and Germany. It has, frankly, fallen behind.\n\nI was privileged to drive one of the 240 XJR 100s the British subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. will send to the colonies this year. Of all the XJ series – the big sedans – this one stands at the pinnacle.\n\nThe XJR series per se features a supercharged V-8 engine for those who like to dream about touring at twice the national speed limit, and getting to that speed in a hurry.\n\nThe “100” part is a tribute to the 100th birthday of Sir William Lyons, who founded Jaguar. Not just a cosmetic enhancement, the 100 package ($6,950) brings to the party 19-inch BBS modular wheels, the largest available in this line, Brembo brakes with cross-drilled rotors and a number of specific trim items, including what they call a red-stitched black leather interior. (To me, it looked orangeish, and rather out of place; but I AM a commoner.)\n\nNo question – the big Jag is the most distinctive, and most appealing-looking of the mega-cars, by which I mean Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S class, Infiniti Q45 and Lexus LS430.\n\nEven without the chromed “leaper” (a pouncing Jaguar) hood ornament, it would be instantly recognizable in that big-bucks crowd. It looks as if it’s about three feet tall. Actually, it’s 52.7 inches high, which is only about 4 inches less than the competition, but it’s enough to make it look striking.\n\nIt’s also enough to make it very unpleasant to get into if you’re anywhere near the 6-foot range. The roofline is of course low, the seat is fairly high and the blasted steering wheel has only a slight range of tilt; there’s no way to ease into this car swiftly or without forethought. That may be fine for a two-seater – heck, I could get into jumping over the door in one of those – but not in a luxury ride. Fitting a decent American tilt steering wheel would help the driver a lot.\n\nThe driver, in turn, would have to give up some of his legroom to accommodate even average-sized adults in the rear. There’s a long-wheelbase XJ which I’d consider if hauling another couple were a priority.\n\nOnce you’ve wrapped the car around you, you can luxuriate in the visual, tactile and olfactory sensations which the British are so adept at providing. Connolly hides, of course, just like Rolls-Royce, buttery soft and redolent. Burl walnut trim that seems too good to be true, but you just know it is. (A matter of taste, but I’d prefer the dark honey stain to the “sporty” charcoal treatment they’ve given the XJR wood.)\n\nFit and finish in line with the rep of limited-edition British cars.\n\nThe XJR weighs a trifle over two tons, not so bad for this class. If it had the standard engine’s 290 hp, it would be a brisk performer. With the 370 ponies a supercharger flogs out of the 32-valve V-8, it’s practically a hotrod. (The thirsty V-12, alas, has been retired.)\n\nTorque is more of an issue, of course, especially in speed-constrained societies, and with a maximum of 387 foot-pounds (achieved at 3,600 rpm), the XJR is well-qualified there, too. The big Jag does not have the explosive launch feel one would get from a big pushrod American V-8 with comparable numbers. It takes off in a dignified fashion. The rear tires (huge 255/35s with the 100 package) showed no sign of losing their grip even when I dumped the throttle.\n\nThe supercharger helped produce a smooth flow of power on up to about 3,500 rpm, and then things started to happen very quickly indeed. The surge was akin to what one experienced with old-style turbochargers – like going on afterburner. Net result was 0-60 times in the sub-6-second range, which would leave most sporty little cars in the dust. Good thing, too, because we’ll never exploit (legally) this car’s ability to cruise at mega-velocities. The speedometer went to 170 mph, which I’d guesstimate (honest, officer), was not exceedingly optimistic.\n\nThe Jag does demand some attention to the speedometer; thoroughbred that it is, it hunkers best when the speedo gets into the three-digit range (so I read in a book), and auditory clues are insufficient to let you know you’re being indiscreet.\n\nSpeed – even when you don’t get caught – has a price. A blueblood like this of course was raised on premium fuel, and it has become quite fond of it. The EPA estimates are 16 mpg city, 22 highway. That level of conspicuous consumption brings with it a $1,300 “gas guzzler” levy, which given the audience at this price level, is a bit silly. My 15.7-mpg tally suggests either I was listening to Satan too often or my math skills need polishing.\n\nWith those monster contact patches, the Jag feels obsessed with keeping in touch with the pavement, and the chassis is sufficiently rigid – if not quite up to today’s standards – to make it feel as tossable as a sporty compact.\n\nLike its fellow luxury rides, the Jag comes equipped with both the more mundane traction control and “stability control” – an interplay of sensors and computers designed to keep the driver out of trouble by not allowing him to ask for more turning angle than, at any given moment, the car is capable of delivering.\n\nThe Jaguar’s was particularly sensitive, I thought, not even allowing the rear end to swing out on wet surfaces. It intervened with braking force and a power cut almost before my driving coach could articulate concern – and that’s fast. What fun is that? Happily, those who enjoy the sense of being master of the mount (and are a little crazy) can disable the censor.\n\nHandling was a bit rubbery and vague at times, although the car remained tenaciously wedded to pavement wet and dry. Ride quality was, for this class, a bit harsh, despite the Computer Active Technology Suspension (CATS – get it?), which purportedly adjusts the shock absorbers in response to driving conditions. Pity there’s no “plush” setting – an $80-grand ride should exclude life’s unpleasantries, as do the competitors.\n\nAs I checked tire pressures, I noted a curious bit of advice in the owner’s manual. Stipulated pressures “for comfort up to 100 mph” are 26 front, 28 rear. “Normal” pressures are defined as 32/34. That’s quite a margin, and suggests Coventry is sensitive to owner’s commentaries on the ride harshness. I made them 32/34.\n\nThe XJR’s brakes were simply awesome; however, upon delivery, they showed a tendency to pull to the left. Some extremely-high-rate stops seemed to even them out a bit, and stopping distances were extraordinarily short, without a hint of fade. Antilock, o f course, and of course it purred. Sorry.\n\nThe navigation system is, compared with others available much farther down the food chain, pitiful – small, poorly placed, and hard to read.\n\nThe power sunroof, I submit, would be more appealing as a moonroof, i.e., with glass instead of steel, so as to lighten the interior.\n\nThe XJR’s upgraded Alpine sound system was excellent in both sensitivity and tonality.\n\nNeither the Feds nor the insurance folks have seen fit to crash this low-volume piece. It has front and side air bags, but lacks head-curtain air bags, which are an emergent “must” in this range. With its maneuverability and mass, I’d nonetheless consider the big Jag a fairly survivable platform.\n\nBase price on the XJR is $71,830. Add in the X100 package, guzzler levy and freight, and you get a tidy $80,725.\n\nIf one needed to subject oneself to the indignity of time-financing, the monthly levies would be $1,637. This assumes 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 payments.",

Check back later for full details.\n\n\nTopping the XJ range is the new XJR, which Jaguar says is the most powerful XJ it has ever produced. Powered by a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 making 550 horsepower and 502 pounds-feet of torque, the 2014 is considerably more powerful than the 2013 model. That power is channeled through an eight-speed automatic transmission, allowing the new XJR to do zero to 60 in 4.4 seconds, with a top speed of 174 mph. Standard are 20-inch forged alloy wheels, and styling enhancements include a new front air splitter, special rocker sills, and a unique front spoiler and hood vents. A glossy black mesh grille with chrome trim furthers its more aggressive look. Inside, there’s a Jet Black suede headliner and R-exclusive black leather sport seats with ivory, tan or red inserts and contrast stitching; R logos are also embossed into the seats. An 18-speaker Meridian sound system is standard.",

      "expert_review": "Technology mutes elitism by making widely available things once held as exclusive. Increased accessibility leaves nobility exposed to the wisdom and will of the masses. It turns luxury into necessity and destroys the concept of prestige in the process.\n\nConsider as an example the 2008 Jaguar XJR Supercharged sedan. It is one of the most expensive, most luxurious, best-performing Jaguars ever made. That certainly makes it exclusive. But there is precious little on the XJR Supercharged sedan that cannot be found on a good middle-income family car, or on an entry-level luxury automobile, or on a rival luxury model at a substantially lower price.\n\nWhat, then, happens to Jaguar prestige? It goes begging in the marketplace — especially in one challenged by rising fuel prices — bereft of the allure or value it once held. That is why Jaguar, currently owned by Ford, is up for sale. That is why Jaguar Cars, facing many financial woes, sold itself to Ford in 1989.\n\nPrestige thrives on exclusivity, on the desire of the masses to own or have access to what is available to few, which largely is why the few people who can afford it are willing to pay for it. But where is the prestige in the XJR Supercharged sedan’s 400-horsepower V-8 engine in a world where 200-horsepower engines for pitifully ordinary cars are the norm, and where anyone who can spend $30,000 can get a big 5.7-liter, 340-horsepower Dodge Hemi V-8 that would give any Jaguar a run for its money?\n\nWhat is the value of excessive horsepower in the Era of Minimalist Snobbery when individuals and governments are eager to buy a Toyota Prius or a similar gasoline-electric hybrid car to show the world they are committed to clean and green living?\n\nNever mind that current generation gasoline-electrics are the least-efficient hybrid models; never mind that they come with a looming environmental problem (battery disposal) of their own; never mind that their current-generation nickel metal hydride batteries soon will be rendered obsolete by lithium ion and lithium polymer power packs, or that advanced common-rail diesel engines are just as fuel-efficient, or that cars powered by hydrogen and compressed natural gas have cleaner tailpipes.\n\nPrius frenzy, which speaks more to fashion than it does to solution, represents a turn away from the mind-set that once supported Jaguar’s prominence — the notion that more horsepower is always better, the idea that only the rich deserve the best technology.\n\nFor example, the onboard navigation system in the XJR Supercharged sedan is second-rate, in terms of functionality and presentation, to similar systems in many General Motors, Honda and Toyota cars. GM’s OnStar emergency communications system, which can be had in bread-and-butter Chevrolet models, trumps anything offered by Jaguar.\n\nLook at safety. The elegantly styled XJR Supercharged sedan has side and head air bags, electronic stability and traction control — in effect, nothing special or outstanding. Consider that in a few months Mercedes-Benz will bring to U.S. shores its minuscule Smart for Two car, which will have all the safety equipment offered by the XJR Supercharged sedan starting at $12,000. Depending on the model chosen, the Smart car can get 45 to 60 miles per gallon — without gas-electric hybrid technology.\n\nViewed another way, prestige in the automobile market has shifted from cars that have the biggest engines and most baubles to those that can go farthest at the lowest cost on the least amount of fuel. The new automotive boast will go something like this: “My Smart gets better mileage than your Prius without a dual gasoline and electric propulsion system. So, there!”\n\nIn that milieu, cars such as the XJR Supercharged sedan will become pricey anachronisms, plush representations of a bygone era when cheap gasoline seemed eternally available, when the only good horsepower was more horsepower, and when a man’s house was his castle, as opposed to a mini-mansion with a media room, kitchen island, and Viking appliances that was built in six months on a suburban lot.\n\nI take no pleasure in noting this changed world and Jaguar’s apparent inability, as represented by the XJR Supercharged sedan, to cope with it. Perhaps, I am an old-fashioned snob at heart. I yearn for the days when Jaguar meant something special, when the use of expensive real-wood veneer and perfectly stitched, supple leather weren’t viewed as egregious assaults on Mother Earth. I miss the days when a wonderfully smooth, 400-horsepower engine easily placed me ahead of most other cars on the road — not to be chased, and often passed, by automobiles with Dodge, Chevrolet, Ford, Acura, Audi and Lexus badges.\n\nBut those days have disappeared — effectively erased by technology that has empowered the masses, and made irrelevant by a rapidly growing global appetite for oil, a natural resource that is getting more difficult to develop. In that world, the high-end Jaguar has become a dinosaur.\n\nNUTS & BOLTS\n\n2008 Jaguar XJR Supercharged\n\nComplaints: Have you ever visited one of those grand old European castles? They are breathtaking, stunning in so many respects, romantically haunting. But few of us would be willing to give up our urban condos or suburban houses to live in one. I am left with that feeling after a week in the Jaguar XJR Supercharged sedan.\n\nDrive, acceleration and handling: Excellent in all respects. But there are many substantially less expensive automobiles that are just as thrilling. Also, there’s this: In one of those infamous Washington Beltway traffic jams, the XJR Supercharged sedan doesn’t move any faster or go any farther than a Chevrolet Aveo subcompact.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Simply beautiful — sensuous, elegantly sculpted all-aluminum body. If you view this car as sculpture, a piece of art, it could be worth the price.\n\nBody style/layout: The Jaguar XJR Supercharged sedan is a front-engine, full-size, rear-wheel drive, premium luxury automobile.\n\nEngine/transmission: The standard engine is a 4.2-liter, double overhead cam, 32-valve, supercharged (meaning that it has a device to force more fresh air into the engine) V-8 that develops 400 horsepower at 6,100 revolutions per minute and 413 pound-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. The engine is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that can be shifted manually.\n\nCapacities: There is seating for five. Luggage capacity is 16.4 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 22.3 gallons of required premium unleaded gasoline. “Required” means no substitutes.\n\nMileage: I averaged 22 miles per gallon in highway runs.\n\nSafety: Antilock brakes, electronic stability and traction control, side and head air bags are standard equipment.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2008 Jaguar XJR Supercharged sedan is $83,585. Dealer’s invoice price is $76,063.\n\nPrice as tested is $84,250, including a $665 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $76,728. That is without the optional, two-video screen multimedia package, which costs $2,950 here, but often is available as standard equipment, or as an easily affordable option on many ordinary vehicles.

It has to do with what Sir William Lyons tried to capture in the marque he created: “Grace, pace and space.”\n\nJaguar is a sexy mix of sleek style, impeccable road manners, effortless speed and gracious accommodations.\n\nWhile the entry-level X-Type has been disappointing in this regard, the S-Type, XJ and XJR all feel like the real deal.\n\nSo the thought of a new XJ platform being overseen by the cost-conscious Ford Motor Co. was cause for trepidation.\n\nThen I saw the car.\n\nWhile the front end was reassuringly familiar, the new XJ’s larger size, and higher stance lacks the lithe look of the older car. From the rear door on back, it resembles a Buick LeSabre.\n\nThe looks may be lacking in the posterior, but there’s little doubt the rest of the car lives up to the legend.\n\nFord has gone to great lengths to modernize a car whose previous architecture dated to the disco era. The new XJ uses an equally new platform mated to a lightweight all-aluminum body. The body uses rivet bonding and adhesives in its construction, just as in the aerospace industry. The result is a body that is 60 percent stiffer, yet 40 percent lighter than the old XJ body.\n\nThat helps keep this big cat light on its feet.\n\nThere are a variety of XJ trim levels. The standard car, the XJ8, is equipped with an aluminum 4.2-liter V-8 rated at 294 horsepower.\n\nMated to a new ZF 6-speed automatic transmission, that’s good enough to sprint to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds.\n\nThe XJ8 also is available in a long-wheelbase version, the XJ8 Vanden Plas, mated to the same powertrain. If you need a quicker kitty, you’ll want to opt for the XJR, which takes a sporting approach to the standard XJ8. This includes replacing the standard V-8 with a supercharged version of the 4.2-liter V-8. At 390 horsepower, this car reaches 60 miles per hour 1.3 seconds sooner than the standard car.\n\nNot that you’d really notice.\n\nBoth the XJ8 and XJR feel plenty quick on their feet. The supercharger’s whine and slightly quicker response is the only difference that most people will notice. That means most will find the XJR’s $74,995 base price harder to swallow than the XJ8’s $59,995 base price.\n\nIf $59,995 sounds more like a nice yearly salary than the base price of a car, realize that the XJ8 starts at $13,325 less than the Mercedes Benz S420, one of Jaguar’s key competitors.\n\nCertainly from a performance standpoint, there’s little to complain about and much to praise.\n\nThe 2004 Jaguar XJ8 and XJR continue to deliver the superb, cat-like reflexes and luxurious ride without a feeling of floating. It’s certainly more fun to drive than most of its competition.\n\nYet something has been lost.\n\nIn recent decades, these large cats expertly balanced the handling side of the equation wi th a suppleness that coddled its occupants. Some of that suppleness has been lost. Where bumpy roads were once handled with dispatch, they now register with a firmness that’s unseemly for a cat from Coventry.\n\nAdditionally, both a Jaguar XJ8 and XJR pulled to one side under heavy braking. This was worrisome in the two different samples I tested and bears looking at if you test drive one. Otherwise, performance is what you’d expect.\n\nInside, the cabin continues to deliver the luxurious accommodations that Jaguar buyers expect.\n\nThe folks at Ford have done an expert job of updating the traditional Jaguar look that is accented with yards of leather and burled walnut veneer.\n\nAll the “mod cons” are here as well, including a self-leveling air suspension, electronic brake assist, anti-lock brakes, 12-way power front seats, dual zone automatic climate control, and a fine 140-watt eight-speaker audio system.\n\nOpt for the XJR and Jaguar adds the supercharged V-8 along with a performance suspension, Brembo brakes, 19-inch Z-rated performance tires, power folding mirrors, front and rear heated seats and a heated steering wheel.\n\nBoth test vehicles boast the same spacious cabin and spacious trunk (which was large enough to hold two close friends.) This is where the slightly bloated styling pays dividends, as the old model had a tight back seat.\n\nIn addition, the new car is taller, so entry and exit to the passenger compartment isn’t as difficult as in the old car.\n\nThe one thing that is more difficult to deal with is the parking distance control.\n\nThis sensor emits an audible warning to the driver when his car is about to meet unexpectedly with an object. The problem is over-sensitivity – warning the driver too early and often. If the driver turns it off, it resets to the “on” position every time the car shuts off. Really, if you can’t park this car without electronic aids, you shouldn’t be driving at all.\n\nThe only other quibble is the hood ornament, aka “the leaper.” It is placed far back on the hood. Obviously, this is done so the driver can see it. But looking at the car from the front, it appears misplaced.\n\nOverall mileage was about 18 mpg, including some highway driving. The XJ8 requires premium fuel.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nEven if the car does look like a fat cat, Jaguar still delivers a sports sedan performance that is as entrancing as it ever was.\n\nThe 2004 Jaguar XJR\n\nEngine: Supercharged 4.2-liter DOHC, 390-horsepower V8\n\nTransmission: 6-speed ZF automatic\n\nTires: P235/40R19\n\nWheelbase: 119.4 inches\n\nLength: 200.4 inches\n\nWidth: 73.2 inches\n\nWeight: 3,948 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 16.6 cubic ft.\n\n0-60 mph: 5.0 seconds\n\nTop speed: 155 mph\n\nBase price: $74,995\n\nAs tested: Not available\n\nEPA rating: 17 city, 24 highway\n\nTest mileage: 16 mpg\n\nFuel type: Premium\n\nBuilt in: England",

      "expert_review": "The driving life with young children is wild in itself – any attempt to maintain an orderly vehicle is a façade at best, a complete failure at worst. Seatbacks become a vertical stomping ground and windows are painted with any number of grotesque substances, from banana sludge to sticky mango fruit leather. My 2-year-old monkey has even been caught swinging from the ceiling handle as though he were dangling in the canopy of a jungle.\n\nAs if all that normal kiddie abuse weren’t enough, we decided to step things up a notch by testing the Jaguar XJR’s survival potential out in the wild: Camping with kids at a national park. Surrounded by everything from bears to mountain lions, this Jaguar should feel right at home, shouldn’t it? Even for those who aren’t the camping type, I’ve known a couple of desperate moms who have succumbed to this adventurous affair for the sake of their pleading children. The reason is simple: Barefoot children with s’mores-smudged mouths and chocolate-stained clothing, jumping up and down all around a tent, seem to share a common trait: They grin from ear to ear!\n\nA successful camping trip requires lots of stuff, and at first glance the Jaguar’s trunk looks misleadingly tiny. Luckily, my husband packed the car and fit in a respectable amount of gear: four sleeping bags, two Therm-a-Rests, a full-sized air mattress, one tent, a stove, a cooler, camping cookware, two kid’s camping chairs, clothes for all and diapers for one. Because the trunk’s opening is so shallow, we were able to easily remove the entire camping arsenal, only to put most of it right back in again due to pesky bears in the area. Yikes! The center console is a bear – by far the tiniest I’ve ever seen, made to store a cell phone, a couple of pens, a credit card and nothing more. The only item I kept in there was my digital camera, which barely fit. Even my husband, who rarely pays attention to those kinds of things, laughingly questioned where the other part of the center console was. The two front cupholders also look miniscule, but they nicely housed both a bottle of Perrier and – later on, in an effort to decompress from the primitive weekend – a great big espresso ice cream shake.\n\nThe highlight in storage space is the rear center armrest. My sons were ecstatic that they not only had the standard cupholders, but also a place for their snacks, a separate activity tray for their Legos and a slot for crayons and pencils. The rear side window blinds and automatic rear window shade also gave the kids a nice break from the intense sunlight pouring into the vehicle.\n\nUnfortunately, our little backseat passengers were also able to easily tinker with the temperature control and seat-heater buttons on the rear of the center console, which turned disastrous in short order. My toddler’s busy toes were constantly finding their way to these controls, raising and lowering the fan speed, while our 6-year-old felt obligated to tattle on his brother with relentless consistency. While I’m on a rant, let me not forget to mention that the Latch child-seat anchors are as difficult to access as a bear-proof trash container is for a bear. I also found accessing the climate controls through the navigation system much too cumbersome; I prefer plain old buttons for such basic functions.\n\nAside from some of its shortcomings – and disregarding the curious looks we got – the Jaguar XJR performed better than expected in the wilderness. As we left the campground, a BMW owner admiringly waved us on, commenting, “There goes the fast cat.” Indeed, it took cruise control to keep this supercharged cat’s speed in check. Like many a wild beast, this one does not like to lollygag, and it has power as well as grace.\n\n*For more information on the Jaguar XJR and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Jaguar’s XJR is a car of considerable contrasts. Some of the sexiest sheetmetal in the automotive kingdom sits atop wide 18-inch wheels with tires so thin they look like rubberbands. Picture a sprinter in a tuxedo wearing track spikes and you get the idea.\n\nAnd what a sprinter it is. Unleash all 370 supercharged horsepower and it squirts to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, just a few tenths of a second slower than such luminaries as the Chevrolet Corvette and Porsche 911. Pull out in the passing lane, mash the throttle and it pins your ears back so you look like a Labrador in the back of a pickup truck at 60 mph. Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph, but that’s academic unless you live in Germany.\n\nJaguar says the XJR is intended to be a five-passenger sedan that “delivers a thrilling rush to autobahn velocity,” yet remains docile at low speed. It succeeds at both. Should you want to mosey around town and revel in its luxury, you can do that with no hint that it has the reflexes of a jungle cat.\n\nThe XJ8, upon which the XJR is based, comes from the marriage of the XJ body to the aluminum 4.0-liter V8 that first saw duty in the XK8 sports car. Its supercharged sister was created by bolting an Eaton supercharger and two air-to-water intercoolers to the aluminum twin-cam V8, tightening up the suspension and adding the five-spoke wheels with Pirelli P Zero high-performance tires. Chrome mesh fills the grille trimmed in body-color paint.\n\nThis engine develops 387 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm. Torque is the force that spins the tires when you touch the gas. Even as low as 1,600 rpm it produces more torque than the normally aspirated engine does at its peak. Getting this much brawn to the pavement is the job of a Mercedes-Benz five-speed automatic transmission engineered to handle this high torque output. This unit, with Normal and Sport modes, starts off in second gear unless you slam the throttle wide open.\n\nInside, the almost-black bird’s eye maple trim contrasts nicely with the off-white, embossed Connolly leather. The power bucket seats have sizable bolsters for lateral and lumbar support, but the bottom cushions didn’t have as much under-thigh length and support as I like.\n\nWith a car this fast it’s important to keep an eagle eye on the speedometer, but I found the speedometer, and tachometer, were hard to read because they are small, set deeply into the instrument panel and have numbers that are not brightly lit. Maybe my middle-aged eyes were playing tricks on me or maybe I just wanted a good excuse for not knowing how fast I was going.\n\nBecause the roof is low and the console wide, the interior felt more like a four-passenger sport coupe. My smaller-than-average feet continually snagged the carpeting around the pedals, and the handbrake rubbed on my right leg.\n\nThe 113-inch wheelbase and 197.8-inch overall length creates adequate back-seat legroom and a good-sized trunk.\n\nAs you can im agine, for a car with a list price of $67,400 the list of standard equipment is substantial. It has heated front seats, a 240-watt Harman Kardon stereo with CD changer, front and side airbags, Automatic Stability Control (ASC) as well as low-speed traction control, anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control, tilt/telescope wheel, electric sunroof and keyless entry.\n\nJaguar plans to import only a limited number of XJR’s, not surprising since it is targeted at the hardcore performance driver who also wants elegant looks, ferocious power and has the money to afford both.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $67,400, and the sticker price was $67,980.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Three-hundred and seventy horsepower in a luxury sedan? Whew! It accelerates like a sports car, corners like it was on rai and cruises like a jet plane.\n\nCounterpoint: The gauges were hard for me to read, there wasn’t adequate room around the pedals for my feet and the handbrake rubbed my right leg.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 4.0-liter, V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 113 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,075 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $67,400\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $67,980\n\nMPG RATING: 16 city, 21 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Nothing you have driven can prepare you for the aural, visual, tactile and olfactory sensations you’ll experience behind the wood-trimmed wheel of Jaguar’s stunning XJR sedan.\n\nFrom the moment you settle into the firm leather-covered bucket seat, you know that this is a very special automobile.\n\nYour heart starts beating a bit quicker even before you turn the key and awaken the supercharged322-horsepower, straight-six engine.\n\nThis is one rare automotive instance where anticipation is not greater than realization. The XJR exceeds the hype. This car thrills and delights the driver and his or her passengers in so many ways.\n\nFor Jaguar, the XJR is nothing less than a triumph, not just for its elegant style, blistering performance and high-quality assembly, but because this is the first Jaguar that is worthy of being viewed in the same light as the best from Mercedes, BMW or Lexus.\n\nPut another way, the XJR is one of the world’s best cars.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIt seems as if Jaguar engineers turned to General Electric, Rolls-Royce or some other manufacturer of jet engines for inspiration when they were building the sophisticated power plant that propels the XJR.\n\nWhen you press the XJR’s accelerator, it’s as if you are shooting down a runway in a Boeing 747. The force of the acceleration and the sounds are nearly identical.\n\nYou hear a deep turbine-like whine as the XJR’s engine builds rpms and the car rockets forward.\n\nWhat an incredible feeling.\n\nThe XJR sports Jaguar’s first-ever production supercharged engine. (Other supercharged Jags have been built over the years, but they were used for racing.)\n\nThe supercharged double-overhead cam, 24-valve, six-cylinder engine is a piece of sculptured aluminum artwork that delivers awesome power at all speeds. A recent test of an XJR by Motor Trend magazine yielded a 0-to-60 mph time of 6.6 seconds. Many sports cars can’t even equal that.\n\nA supercharger, by the way, is a mechanically driven pump that packs more air and fuel into the engine. Unlike a turbocharger – which is driven by exhaust gases – there is no hesitation when you step on the throttle. You get full power instantly with a supercharged engine.\n\nIn non-supercharged form, Jaguar’s 4.0-liter six makes 245 horsepower. The supercharger boosts output to 322.\n\nIn a sense the XJR is something of an iron fist concealed in a velvet glove. Although quick, the XJR also is amazingly smooth, and if you don’t mash the accelerator into the carpet, the wonderful symphony of mechanical noises from underneath the bonnet is nearly inaudible.\n\nMore than anything, it is the engine that gives this Jaguar its special character and personality. It makes all the right noises, and it makes you feel good every time you drive it.\n\nThe XJR comes only with a four-speed automatic transmission. When accelerating quickly, the shifts are crisp and well-timed. A button on the console near the sh ifter allows the driver to select between sport and normal shift modes, although changing settings barely changes performance.\n\nOur British Racing Green test car imbibed one gallon of premium unleaded every 14 miles in city driving. Rarely, though, has it been so painless to pull up to a gas pump and have your wallet emptied at such frequent intervals.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe XJR, outfitted with massive 17-inch tires and a firm suspension system, is the finest-handling sedan Jaguar has ever built.\n\nOur test car cornered as if if were on rails. No matter what speed or how sharp a curve I tossed the XJR into, the body would not lean. The XJR is amazingly stable, calm and easy to control under duress.\n\nWhat an incredible feeling.\n\nThe highest performance sedans from Mercedes-Benz and BMW have nothing on the XJR.\n\nUnderneath, this cat has a four-wheel independent suspension system, what felt like aircraft strength four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, and a fast-act ng, speed-sensitive, power-assisted steering system.\n\nThe suspension system is out fitted with a device that prevents the front of the car from diving during heavy braking and squatting on fast acceleration.\n\nIf the XJR has a shortcoming it is that it doesn’t handle small bumps with the usual graceful aplomb of a Jaguar sedan. A speed bump or minor pothole will cause the XJR to shudder somewhat. The firm suspension doesn’t give much over bumps, and the trauma is felt throughout the car. In a regular Jag XJ6, such an incongruity in the pavement would be dismissed without the driver sensing anything amiss.\n\nNevertheless, the XJR is an invigorating, exhilarating automobile.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nNo other car smells quite like a Jaguar.\n\nThe pungent aroma and sculpted beauty of the XJR’s leather seats are nothing less than intoxicating.\n\nInfact, it is that wonderful leather upholstery and the gorgeous wood interior that assuage your displeasure with XJR’s numerous interior shortcomings:\n\n– There is a small panel behind the steering wheel that houses the lights and cruise control. Reaching many of the buttons on this panel is akin to making your way through an obstacle course.\n\n– Headroom is not particularly good, especially if you are 6 feet or taller.\n\n– The electrically adjustable seats can be bothersome to configure because the switches that control them are located on the lower cushion near the door panel. Thankfully, the XJR comes with a memory system that controls the seats, mirrors and steering wheel. Once you store the settings (it holds three) you don’t have to fiddle with it again.\n\nThe XJR leaves the factory in Coventry, England, one way: fully loaded. Nearly every luxury item you can think of is standard equipment. The list includes power sunroof, radio-controlled door locks, multi-disc CD player, electrically operated tilt steering wheel, power windows, door locks and mirrors, front and rear fog lights, traction control and dual air bags.\n\nDuring a week of hard driving, our test car performed flawlessly. Armed with Ford’s money (Ford Motor Co. bought Jaguar in 1989) Jaguar has made tremendous improvements in the way it designs and assembles its cars.\n\nValue is hard to define on a $65,000luxury car.\n\nBut I can tell you this: I’ve driven cars that cost twice as much as the XJR that have done nothing for me, aroused no emotions and were instantly forgettable.\n\nBut the XJR made me feel special, and I could feel good about spending this much on a car.\n\nAfter testing cars week in and week out, some of the thrill is gone. And then every now and then a car like the XJR comes along and reminds me why I love cars so much.\n\nTruett’s tip: Jaguar’s supercharged sedan is the quickest and most agile that the British automaker ever has built. The car is a styling and performance tour de force.",
