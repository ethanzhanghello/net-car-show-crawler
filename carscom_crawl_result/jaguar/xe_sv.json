      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Jaguar XE?\n\nThe Jaguar XE is a compact luxury sports sedan that seats up to five people. It offers several engines: a 247-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter gas four-cylinder; a 180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 296-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter gas four-cylinder; and a 380-hp, supercharged 3.0-liter gas V-6. All engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and all-wheel drive are offered. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4. The XE has been refreshed for the 2020 model year.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Jaguar XE?\n\nAll XEs now have Jaguar’s InControl Touch Pro multimedia system, which gets minor changes this year. There’s also a new Landmark Edition with special exterior and interior cues.\n\nA new high-performance XE SV Project 8 is also available. Powered by a 592-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine, the SV Project 8 is hand-built in England and can reach a top speed of 200 mph. Features include manually adjustable ride height and aerodynamics, as well as carbon-ceramic brakes. The SV Project 8 seats four, and only 300 will be built worldwide.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Jaguar XE Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors, dual-zone climate control, a 10-inch touchscreen multimedia system and Bluetooth streaming audio. Available features include power-folding side mirrors, a 40/20/40-split folding backseat, a Meridian stereo, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, navigation, a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial), lane keep assist, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Jaguar XE?\n\nXE highlights include steering feel, handling and ride comfort. The supercharged V-6 is a strong performer, too. Downsides include poor rear visibility, a snug cabin and inconsistent interior materials. You may be able to find a deal on a 2019 XE as dealers look to make room for the updated 2020 model.",
