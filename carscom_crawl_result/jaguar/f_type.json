      "expert_review": "A tour de force of eager power, engaging dynamics and head-turning looks, the 2014 Jaguar F-Type roadster is Jaguar’s first pure sports car in decades.\n\nNot to take anything away from the longtime Cars.com favorite XK, but that model — despite its excellent athleticism — is still more of a touring vehicle, and one with four seats. The F-Type is a rear-wheel-drive, soft-top roadster — at least until a coupe comes along in the undetermined future. And the F-Type is no touring car.\n\nA supercharged V-6 powers the base and S trim levels, and a supercharged V-8 propels the F-Type V8 S. I drove S trim versions of both engines, on a track as well as the roads around Seattle. See all three versions side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe car carries the name F-Type because it’s the spiritual successor to the classic E-Type. The F-Type’s styling isn’t in the E-Type’s ballpark … or county, yet it catches the eye among humdrum modern vehicles, and even within Jaguar’s own lineup. To me it merely resembles a Jaguar, partly because of its more vertically oriented headlights and thin-slit taillights. Point of interest: A Jaguar designer says the headlight cluster was inspired by Darth Vader’s TIE fighter. (I’m not sure I see it, but if you think about it, the Empire’s higher ranks were thick with British accents.)\n\nFrom the outside, the V-6 and V-8 versions look practically identical. Look for two large-bore, centered tailpipes on the V-6 and two outboard pairs with the V-8. Each trim level adds more standard gloss-black accents, but optional Black Packs can make the lower trim levels as glossy as the higher ones.\n\nHow It Drives\nPractically from a stop, the supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 has ample torque, and the F-Type S sprints to 60 mph in an estimated 4.8 seconds — 0.3 second faster than the base trim level — aided by a shorter final-drive ratio and a 40-horsepower increase for a total of 380 hp. (Unfortunately, the base model and its 340 hp weren’t available for testing, but the specs suggest the S trim’s added power is enjoyed mainly at the top end.) Torque jumps only 7 pounds-feet to 339 in the S, arriving at 3,500 rpm and extending flat to 5,000 rpm.\n\nIf you can get past the revolting absence of a manual transmission, you’ll find the F-Type’s drivetrains among its many high points. Though it’s a conventional design, the eight-speed automatic transmission performs well, trading the instantaneous shifting of dual-clutch technology for smooth engagement when the traffic signal turns green. A Sport transmission mode can be activated to raise the shift points and lower the threshold for downshifts. (A configurable Dynamic mode in the S trim level activates this mode, too.) You can also shift manually with steering-wheel paddles or the gear-selector lever. The rubber-coated plastic shift paddles are a tactile blunder.\n\nDual-clutch automatics are proliferating in the market, but I don’t think you’re losing much, if anything, here. The transmission upshifts and downshifts quickly, jumping multiple gears when called upon without the annoying behavior of stepping through each gear on the way. But as I’ve said of other eight-speeds, once a transmission exceeds six gears, manual shifting becomes a bit tedious.\n\nAs expected, the 495-hp, supercharged V-8 does more than hasten the zero-to-60 time to roughly 4.2 seconds. It transforms the driving experience. You feel the power and 460 pounds-feet of torque at any speed. Even in this heaviest version, extensive use of aluminum and composites keeps the curb weight to 3,671 pounds.\n\nUnfortunately, you feel a transformation in the curves, too: Jaguar says the F-Type’s front/rear weight distribution is 50/50, but it clearly shifts forward in the V-8 version, which understeers in aggressive cornering. An electronically controlled limited-slip differential helps rein in the V-8’s prodigious grunt; a passive mechanical LSD suffices in the F-Type S.\n\nOverall, the dynamics and roadholding are excellent, but I’m mixed on the steering, despite Jaguar’s best intentions of employing conventional hydraulic power assist. Compared with the XK, the F-Type incorporates a stiffer front end, a shorter wheelbase and a quicker steering ratio. I suspect two out of the three might have been a better approach. The steering is exceptionally direct and precise, and the sharp, immediate turn-in was impressive, but it also felt twitchy. It seemed I was doing more correcting than I should have on highways just to track straight, and I noticed a hypersensitivity to steering inputs on the track. Might I have adapted over time? Possibly, but the F-Type definitely doesn’t reward a new driver with the effortlessness of a Porsche 911, which is arguably its main competitor. See these two models, plus the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class hardtop roadster, compared side by side here.\n\nEven with the steering’s directness, somehow feedback was lacking. The S trim’s Dynamic mode allows you to vary the steering assist, but experimentation didn’t alter my impressions.\n\nI love how the driver can configure the Dynamic mode, a capability also available in BMW’s M cars but new to Jaguar. (The capability comes in the Performance Pack S option package, along with other upgrades.) Using the touch-screen, you can choose whether you want regular or more aggressive settings separately for the steering assist, adaptive suspension, transmission shift schedules and throttle response. (I especially like the separation between the transmission and throttle, which many cars combine.)\n\nWith all these settings predetermined, all you need to do is flick the toggle switch on the center console and get everything exactly as you want it for sportier driving.\n\nI’m impressed by the brakes, which do their job consistently, hot or cold. Each trim level has brake rotors sized appropriately for the car’s power and capability.\n\nFor me, the cars’ sound was a disappointment. The F-Type earned a reputation as a spectacular multisensory experience long before I pushed the start button. I was unmoved. With the Active Exhaust, standard on S models, the exhaust note sounds appropriately muted, even when the top’s down. A feature found on other cars, the Active Exhaust’s bypass valves open under spirited acceleration (or when you press a button that keeps them open), giving the cars more to say.\n\nPorsche does a nice job with its horizontally opposed six-cylinder, but V-6 exhaust never sounds as good to me. The F-Type’s exhaust tuning doesn’t help much; the cart just sounds like it’s trying too hard to impress.\n\nSomehow the V-8 puts up a similar front. I always love performance-car exhausts that burble and pop on lift-throttle, but with this car, the pops have escalated to cracks — and surprisingly loud ones. With the top up they aren’t terribly intrusive, but a few miles with the top down exposes what everyone on the outside is hearing, and let’s just say it lacks the subtlety of which Jaguar has proved uncommonly capable.\n\nThe growl of other Jags, such as the XK, is intoxicating. It doesn’t happen by accident; engineers obsess over this kind of thing. The beauty is that it seems incidental. In the F-Type, there’s something too deliberate about the car’s sound — like an athlete who talks a lot of trash. Is the blather compensation for inadequacies? Or is this a world-class jock who could let its performance speak for itself, yet insists on mouthing off?\n\nInterior\nLike most roadsters, the F-Type’s cabin is actually quite accommodating for adults. I’m 6 feet tall, and though I wouldn’t have minded a little more legroom, it was more than workable. The headroom is impressive thanks in part to generous up-and-down seat-height adjustment. With the cushion at its lowest point, I had about 3 inches of space between my head and the raised top. Shorter occupants needn’t worry, though: I was able to raise the seat far enough for my noggin to create a molehill in the top.\n\nThe top itself is a high point. Fully automatic, it lowers, raises and latches at the touch of a single switch, and does so in about 11 seconds — faster than any retractable hardtop and operable at up to 30 mph. It’s also admirably quiet with the top up, unlike the Mercedes-Benz SL500, whose hard top fails to isolate noise as well.\n\nThe F-Type has the visibility pros and cons typical of soft-top convertibles. The C-pillar formed by the cloth top is wide and blocks some of the driver’s view to the rear. Usually a roadster’s rear window is close enough to the driver to mitigate the issue, but the F-Type has a mesh wind blocker between the roll bars that’s coarse enough to diminish clarity. Shorter drivers might find that the rear spoiler, which raises automatically at higher speeds, steals a little more of the view. The optional blind spot monitor can help when in motion; for parking purposes I recommend the optional front and rear parking sensors with backup camera.\n\nBoth of the F-Type cars I drove had optional full leather upholstery and the Performance Pack S, which replaces the standard “sport seats” with “performance seats.” Both seat types have prominent side bolsters and high backs with fixed (not adjustable) head restraints, but the performance seats are more sculpted and have a wing-back shape. Both the driver and passenger seats can have memory for 14-way power adjustment including lumbar and side bolsters. The controls are high on the door panels where they’re easily seen and operated … but not very elegant looking.\n\nControls & Electronics\nI’ve long appreciated how Jaguar has stuck with simple touch-screens and judiciously chosen mechanical buttons rather than multifunction controller knobs and touch-sensitive panels. The F-Type continues the tradition. Key buttons flanking the touch-screen provide direct access to high-level menus like Home, Phone, Audio-Video and Nav, along with a couple for the parking sensors and audio source.\n\nMechanical switches and three rotary knobs also operate the most-used climate controls. The outboard knobs adjust the temperature for either occupant, as well as the heated seats. Once pressed, the knob’s integrated display replaces the digital temperature readout with a seat symbol, and an animated icon’s moving arrow shows the user how to set the heat level. Very neat.\n\nLess cool, ironically, is the panel atop the dashboard that motors upward to open the center vents only when needed. Motorized elements are the rage nowadays for gee-whiz factor, and I think this is one of the most gratuitous (just like the vents that rotate open on other Jaguar models). These vents don’t block one’s view when raised, so it’s all gimmick. You can program the car to leave them up.\n\nJaguar might redeem itself with another motorized creature feature in the form of the gear selector. Rather than a conventional lever with separate PRND settings, it’s a springy toggle-style electronic lever, which I don’t care for, but it solves a problem most vehicles haven’t: Once in Drive, you activate the Sport/manual transmission mode by popping the lever to the left into a separate gate. When you come to a stop and push the Park button, the lever moves automatically into the default position and you’re done. Most cars with this layout just beep at you and make you move it yourself. It’s pretty cool, and it serves a real purpose.\n\nI found the touch-screen menus pretty easy to use, though the system suffers the delayed response I’ve noted on other Jags and Land Rovers. It seems like this unit just needs a faster processor. Frustrating stuff. The navigation maps are pretty good but a bit stingy with street names, which sadly is the norm. It was pretty easy to pair my Android phone through Bluetooth, but I’ll need more time with the car to know how faithfully it reconnects on successive attempts — an obstacle for some cars.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo and cabin storage space aren’t the F-Type’s strong suit. The glove compartment and storage bin underneath the center armrest are modest, and though another covered cubby between the backrests has decent volume, it’s an awkward shape and location. These limitations aren’t uncommon among roadsters, but the F-Type’s trunk is disappointing even in its class.\n\nLook strictly at the cargo volume figures, and the F-Type’s 7.0-cubic-foot trunk seems adequate versus the Porsche 911 Cabriolet’s 4.8 cubic feet and Mercedes-Benz SL550’s 8.5 cubic feet. The problem is one of shape. While the 911 Cabriolet’s front trunk is smaller by the numbers, it proves a highly accommodating tall shape. (There’s also a little extra space available in the area behind the seats when the top is up.) The F-Type’s trunk has a nice, wide mouth, but it’s quite shallow. A depression just off center in the trunk floor technically increases volume and can help corral grocery bags, but it doesn’t help with stuff like luggage. Even an overstuffed roll-aboard suitcase sticks up enough to frustrate closing the lid.\n\nOn the upside, none of the F-Type’s trunk is sacrificed when the top is down, as it is in the SL550, but here’s the rub: The Benz’s 8.5 cubic feet is with its hard top lowered. When the top’s up, the volume is a generous 13.5 cubic feet. For the record, the 911 Cabriolet is technically a “2+2” because of its tiny backseat. Porsche’s true two-seat roadster, the Boxster, offers 9.9 cubic feet of cargo volume.\n\nSafety\nUnfortunately, neither the F-Type nor its stated competitors have been crash-tested — a common occurrence with low-volume models.\n\nIn the absence of a fixed roof and conventional curtain airbags, Jaguar says, standard side-impact airbags in the seats extend upward to protect occupants in a side collision.\n\nA backup camera option comes in the Vision Pack, which also includes front and rear sonar sensors — well worth it for a low-slung car like this one. The bundle also adds blind spot warning and adaptive headlights that angle toward a turn and have automatic high beams. The package costs $2,400 in the lower trim levels and $2,100 in the F-Type V8 S.\n\nSee all the safety features listed here.\n\nValue\nWith a starting price of $69,895 for the base model, the F-Type is $27,255 more affordable than the base 911 Cabriolet (all prices include destination charges). Even the top, F-Type V8 S trim costs $4,255 less than the base 911 convertible, $18,855 less than the most powerful 911 S Cabriolet and $14,730 below the SL550. In this regard, the F-Type represents value. Loaded with every possible functional and cosmetic option, a V8 tops out at $113,400. That sounds high, but upcharges are common among European luxury brands. I had already exceeded $145,000 when I stopped adding options to the 911 Cabriolet, and there were many left to choose.\n\nKey missing features include adaptive cruise control, and though it’s available as an option, HomeLink isn’t standard on any F-Type trim, as it is on its two competitors. But value comparisons among luxury brands are tough. Much of the value is in the name and reputation, and everyone has a different idea of how much value each brand name has.\n\nTo save some money on an F-Type, I think the V-6 S is the way to go. For an additional $12,000, it has more power and a limited-slip differential that the base model lacks, as well as an adjustable adaptive suspension that combines with the car’s excellent top-up noise isolation to provide day-to-day livability. It sacrifices only 1 mpg, for a rated 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined. The base V-6 gets a predicted 23 mpg combined. The 911 Cabriolet is rated 23 mpg and the 911 S Cabriolet 22 mpg. Both this and the SL550’s 20 mpg beat the F-Type V8 S’ 18 mpg.\n\nJaguar’s been out of this game for too long. It’s good to have it back.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Jaguar F-Type R75 convertible may feel dated on the inside, but with stunning exterior looks and a raucous V-8, it’s hard not to fall in love with it from behind the wheel.\n\nVersus the competition: Even at $120,000, the 2024 F-Type R75 convertible is a relative performance bargain — and it has a soul some competitors lack — but it’s fallen behind technologically, and with this being its final model year, it’s not going to catch up.\n\nJaguar plans to end F-Type production after the 2024 model year, and it’s sending the two-seat sports car off with new special edition trim levels inspired by its racing and sports car heritage. For this test, I drove a convertible version of the top R75 trim, which comes standard with all-wheel drive and a high-performance 575-horsepower, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8.\n\nRelated: 2024 Jaguar F-Type Enters Final Year of Production With 75 Special Edition\n\nWhen I first started working at Cars.com nearly a decade ago, the Jaguar F-Type was close to brand-new and one of the first cars I fell in love with on the job. That love has lasted because of — or maybe in spite of — the fact that Jaguar has made minimal changes to the F-Type during its run. There have been a few tweaks — Jaguar gave it a facelift for 2021, revising the suspension of R models and adding more modern technology, and the available drivetrains have seen tweaks over the years — but the 2024 model I drove recently felt entirely familiar.\n\nI won’t pretend that a small convertible with a screaming supercharged V-8 under the hood isn’t fun to drive; it absolutely is. It elicited nearly the same grins from me that it did almost a decade ago, but is the F-Type leaving with a roar or a whimper? That took some figuring out.\n\nSmiles by the Mile\n\nDriving an F-Type R75 is a mostly delightful experience, with a range of characteristics to match your desired mood. In its Normal driving mode, the car is surprisingly and pleasantly sedate. The ride is comfortable, the throttle isn’t twitchy (despite the nearly 600 horses lurking under the hood) and the brakes aren’t too grabby. City driving and commuting are possible without much frustration.\n\nSwitch the car into its racy R Mode, though, and everything noticeably sharpens and tightens, making the F-Type feel like a ready partner for canyon carving. The steering is direct and communicative, and the adaptive exhaust roars under hard acceleration with one of the best exhaust notes I’ve ever heard. Though I didn’t drive a 2024 coupe, my experience with previous F-Type coupes leads me to believe it will feel a smidge sharper than the convertible. If that’s the only problem with the convertible, though, it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to live with in order to better hear the exhaust sing. Impressively, the F-Type remains fairly livable in R Mode; it was my preferred driving mode. You can also customize the suspension, drivetrain and steering settings to get the best of all worlds.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic transmission that’s standard on all versions of the F-Type deserves praise, too. It snaps off shifts with ease, and while there are paddles mounted on the steering wheel that allow you to change gears yourself, the transmission does its job so well, I found myself ignoring the paddles. That said, the response is excellent if you do use the paddles, so there is fun to be had with them.\n\nThere are, however, some compromises — maybe even flaws — in the driving experience. The ride isn’t overly firm, but it can feel brittle over larger bumps and even smaller ones that occur in quick succession; impacts reverberate throughout the chassis. This isn’t unusual for a sports car with a shorter wheelbase, but driving Chicago’s pockmarked highways in the F-Type was occasionally unpleasant, and going over bumps while cornering sometimes knocked the car off balance. The F-Type’s steering can also be busy, requiring frequent corrections to keep the car from wandering too much. This is more prevalent in the F-Type’s more relaxed steering settings, so drivers may want to keep the steering in a sportier setting, though that will add effort to lower-speed maneuvers.\n\nOutward visibility in the convertible is another compromise, especially for taller drivers. The car sits very low, and the front windscreen is raked in such a way that I had a hard time seeing traffic lights when I was first in line at an intersection. The convertible’s integrated windscreen does a great job reducing wind intrusion with the top down, but it interferes with the view in the rearview mirror. The soft top offers some sound insulation when it’s up, but a lot of road and wind noise still infiltrates the cabin.\n\nLuxurious Comfort for Everyone (Max: 2)\n\nVisibility and noise issues aside, the F-Type’s cabin is lovely, with comfortable seats and high-quality materials on nearly every surface. The cabin is snug, but I never felt cramped. When Jaguar last updated the F-Type’s interior, it added a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 10-inch touchscreen display, and those remain today. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included, but that’s really the extent of the technological advancements in the F-Type’s cabin. The remaining audio and climate controls are physical and easy to use, and there are physical controls on the center console for raising and lowering the convertible top, selecting a drive mode and adjusting the adaptive exhaust. Compared with some luxury cars with complex control systems, the F-Type’s setup is simple, straightforward and sincerely appreciated.\n\nWith its luxurious interior and calm demeanor in normal driving, one could assume that the F-Type has morphed into something of a grand tourer, but that’s not the case; the interior and lack of cargo space refute that notion. Snugness aside, there are only two seats; competitors like the BMW 8 Series, Lexus LC and Porsche 911 offer something that at least looks like a backseat (though I’ve yet to meet a human being of any age who can safely fit in any of them). Grand touring also requires at least some cargo space, and the F-Type’s trunk is sports-car small. One editor was able to fit a Costco-sized package of toilet paper in the trunk but not much else; any luggage larger than a carry-on suitcase will probably be a stretch. Even a single golf bag is a stretch, giving the Chevrolet Corvette a leg up on the F-Type, too. This isn’t so much a flaw, though, as it is simply a reality. The F-Type is for driving enjoyment and not much else. That’s fine.\n\nWhat’s not fine is that the 10-inch touchscreen is very difficult to see when the top is down even in indirect sunlight. Being unable to see the screen could be an inadvertent safety feature — if you can’t see the screen, you won’t try to operate it while driving — but the truth is people will try. The Mercedes-AMG SL, meanwhile, has a built-in tilt feature for its screen that can operate automatically when the top goes down to ensure you can see the screen. The F-Type can’t do that because its screen is integrated into the dashboard, not mounted on it as in the Mercedes. Even when you can see the screen, the graphics are dated and the interface itself is unintuitive and slow. And as luxurious as the interior feels, the shift paddles feel like cheap plastic, and multiple editors noted excessive squeaks and creaks coming from the dashboard.\n\nSo Long, Farewell\n\nEven with those issues, I enjoyed every second I spent driving the F-Type. I would even argue that those issues give the F-Type a bit of character, which is something that’s sorely lacking in most cars today; nearly everything is some degree of fine at worst. The F-Type’s dated tech and creaky but comfortable interior, meanwhile, feels incredibly on brand for Jaguar; it just made me love the F-Type even more.\n\nThe F-Type R75 we drove had an as-tested price of just a hair under $120,000, making it very much not a cheap vehicle — but it’s still something of a value purchase when you consider its performance. The similarly powerful Mercedes-AMG SL 63 starts at more than $180,000, and the cheapest AWD Porsche 911 convertible is $136,150 before any options. BMW’s M850i xDrive is less powerful and only slightly less expensive than the Jag, but the higher-performance M8 Competition convertible costs tens of thousands more than the F-Type I drove.\n\nI’ll be sad to see the F-Type go; it’s a beautiful car full of character and surprising performance value. But it’s also clearly behind the times for 2024; it’s been neglected by Jaguar as the brand makes its transition to an all-electric lineup, and hopefully, any electric replacement that comes along will have even half the F-Type’s character.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nStandardized and Simplified: 2024 Jaguar XF Price Starts at $51,075\n2024 Jaguar F-Pace Gets Infotainment Updates, Starts at $58,275\nSlightly Sleeker: 2024 Jaguar E-Pace Gets Minor Changes, Starts at $50,675\n2024 Jaguar I-Pace Returns With Minor Updates, Starts at $73,275\nShop for a 2024 Jaguar F-Type\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Jaguar F-Type is an exhilarating sports car, but our experience with two early models raises concerns about its build quality.\n\nThe two-seat, rear-wheel-drive F-Type has a range of attributes: intoxicating power and handling, posh cabin materials, alluring proportions, stuff falling apart. That’s right — halfway into our first weekend with an Jaguar F-Type R coupe, one editor walked out of his house to find that the low-80s July heat had overwhelmed the center mirror’s adhesive. There it hung by a wiring harness from the overhead console.\n\nIt’s not the first time something has gone awry in an F-Type, not to mention other Jaguars. We dropped ours at a local dealership, which returned it less than a day later with the mirror remounted. We had no further issues with the car. Still, if you plan to own one past its warranty period, events like this are troubling. It’s a shame, really, because the F-Type is otherwise a marvelous car.\n\nA coupe joins the roadster for 2015. Both cars offer supercharged V-6 or V-8 engines; the V-8 has 495 horsepower in the roadster and 550 hp in the coupe. Compare the whole group here. Our review focuses on the coupe, so click here to read our take on the roadster.\n\nExterior & Styling\nYou didn’t have to look far to imagine a coupe version of the F-Type roadster when it showed up a year ago. Jaguar already had one: the C-X16 concept coupe from 2011, which was the basis for both F-Type body styles. The 2015 F-Type coupe stays faithful to the C-X16, with an attractive profile that sweeps from the A-pillars to the tail without any real corners.\n\nEighteen-inch wheels are standard; 19s and 20s are optional. The Jaguar F-Type R gets the 20s, along with quad tailpipes, the sole visual differentiators. The V-6 F-Type and F-Type S have twin, center-mounted pipes.\n\nHow It Drives\nFed by a Roots-type supercharger, the Jaguar F-Type’s 5.0-liter, direct-injection V8 S makes a hellacious 550 hp that comes on fierce anytime, regardless of vehicle speed or engine rpm. Torque, at 502 lb-ft, wallops you from 2,500 to 5,500 rpm, and accelerator response is immediate. The Jaguar F-Type’s SpeedShift eight-speed automatic kicks down to lower gears as fast as the brand’s earlier — and excellent — six-speed automatics once did. (The eight-speed automatic in some of Jaguar’s other models, by contrast, is more SlowShift.)\n\nWhen you switch the drivetrain to Dynamic Mode — which firms up the adaptive shocks, dials back power-steering assist and sharpens drivetrain response — even half-stabs at the gas can break the rear tires loose. Dynamic Mode also redirects the car’s exhaust down freer-flowing pipes, which turns the exhaust note from a medium baritone to a hissing, popping, rip-snorting snarl. (You can turn this feature on individually, too.) Jaguar calls it Active Sports Exhaust. One editor thought it a bit over-the-top, but so is the drivetrain. For some reason, it all fits.\n\nJaguar says the F-Type R hits 60 mph in a blazing 4 seconds, which is a hair quicker than the F-Type V-8 S roadster (4.2 seconds) and significantly quicker than base and S versions of either body style (4.8 to 5.1 seconds). The F-Type R is quicker than a, eight-cylinder powered Audi R8 or Aston Martin Vantage, as well as the vast majority of Porsche 911s. All three competitors offer quicker variants, to be sure, but none fall anywhere close to the F-Type R’s price.\n\nEven with the V-8’s extra weight, the F-Type’s nose stays relatively put, allowing you to slide the rear out with progressive accelerator inputs. The car rotates easily enough, resisting understeer in most situations — no doubt helped by Jaguar’s Electronic Active Differential, which meters power between the left and right rear wheels and functions as a limited-slip, too. There’s a degree of nimbleness that belies the Jaguar F-Type R’s 3,671-pound curb weight — the same as the V-8 S roadster but a significant 157 pounds more than the heaviest V-6 coupe. Still, even the V-6 F-Type is considerably heavier than its Porsche competitors, as well as the Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nThe Jaguar F-Type R gets disc brakes measuring 15 inches up front and 14.8 inches in back, a big increase over V-6 models’ 13.9/12.8-inch (front/rear) discs. Optional carbon-ceramic brakes employ gargantuan 15.7-inch front discs with yellow-painted six-piston calipers. Equally gargantuan is their price: Packaged with unique, lightweight 20-inch alloy wheels, they run an impossible $12,000.\n\nThe F-Type R’s adaptive suspension has unique damping rates versus the V-8 S roadster (the base car has a fixed, non-adaptive suspension), but with 20-inch alloy wheels, the ride can get choppy at times — even in the suspension’s normal mode.\n\nInterior\nThe Jaguar F-Type’s cockpit sweeps around you, leather-wrapped panels and all. The materials are expectedly upscale, with genuine leather (not vinyl) covering portions of the dash. In an age when even a Toyota Camry has faux-leather dashboard stitching, the real deal found here shames all imposters. Pay another $2,200 for the F-Type R’s Extended Leather package, and you can get a leather headliner, A-pillars and sun visors. Cowhides, come hither.\n\nHeated seats and a heated steering wheel are optional on the F-Type, but cooled or ventilated seats — a common, if usually ineffective, feature among luxury cars — are not. Despite their umpteen adjustments, our test car’s performance seats drew criticism for their rock-hard backrests. Typical of a luxury car, the F-Type offers multiple upholstery options and two different seats. Try the base sport seats, which could be more comfortable. (It’s hard to conceive of them being any less comfortable.)\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe coupe’s trunk has a usable 11 cubic feet of space. That’s significantly more than the roadster’s 7 cubic feet. A power liftgate is optional. Within the two-seat cabin, there’s no rear shelf behind the front seats to throw things onto — just a cubby between the seats, along with the requisite glove compartment and center console.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe standard Meridian audio system comes with Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, USB/iPod connectivity and a navigation system. A surround-sound Meridian system with more speakers and wattage is optional. Keyless access with push-button start is also standard, but a backup camera, aggravatingly, is optional.\n\nThe multimedia and navigation display is an 8-inch touch-screen — a respectable size, but the graphics, both here and in a gauge display, seem outdated, and one editor experienced an annoying degree of lag in response to commands.\n\nSafety\nThe F-Type has not been crash-tested, and given its low sales volume it probably won’t be. Standard safety features include front and head-protecting side airbags, plus the requisite antilock brakes and electronic stability system. A blind spot warning system and automatic high/low beam bi-xenon headlights are optional, but forward collision and lane departure warning systems are not. Click here to see the standard safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe F-Type coupe starts around $66,000 including destination. That’s $4,000 less than the roadster. Standard features include 18-inch wheels, single-zone automatic climate control, Jaguar’s leather and “Suedecloth” upholstery, a navigation system and four-way power seats. Additional seat controls, heated leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, a panoramic moonroof, and 19- or 20-inch wheels are optional. The F-Type S coupe starts around $78,000, while the F-Type R starts around $100,000; the latter is more than the convertible because of its extra performance capabilities. Check every factory option, and the R tops out around $125,000.\n\nThat’s in the thick of luxury sports-car territory, but a few problems concern us. The mirror snafu was our sole issue in the F-Type R, but an Jaguar F-Type V8 S convertible roadster we drove last spring had a spate of bugaboos. Parked on the roof next to Cars.com’s downtown Chicago headquarters, the roadster’s keyless access system refused to recognize our fob, leaving editors unable to lock the car on one occasion and unable to get in on another. It’s possible that antennae signals from nearby skyscrapers played havoc with the transmitter, but we park a lot of test cars up there, including many with keyless access. We’ve only had issues with Jaguars, Land Rovers and a Tesla Model S.\n\nThat’s not all. On another occasion, our convertible roadster’s idle-stop sequence abruptly shut the car off, blank screens and all, while we sat at an intersection. It looked like the car’s seat-belt-off shutdown sequence, but we had our belts on. Finally, in a separate occurrence, the keyless access again refused to recognize our key fob and allow startup, even as we waved the fob where an instrument message said to wave it. We had to go through an exit-reentry sequence before the situation fixed itself.\n\nJaguar has pointed to J.D. Power and Associates’ Initial Quality Study, in which the automaker scores highly in owner surveys for things that go wrong in the first 90 days of ownership. But IQS grades things that break along with things owners simply don’t like, and expectations are an unwelcome influencer. A better gauge for long-term reliability is the firm’s three-year Vehicle Dependability Study, which focuses on objective issues. Jaguar rates about average in the 2014 VDS, which gauges 2011 model year vehicles (read it here).\n\nAll that matters less if you lease the car, where problems are covered under warranty. That accounts for a great deal of Jaguar sales, but no matter how much a Jaguar sympathizer minimizes the inconvenience or chalks it up to the brand’s age-old reputation, glitches are glitches — and the Jaguar F-Type’s are a blemish on an otherwise appealing sports car.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jaguar F-Type?\n\nThe Jaguar F-Type is offered in two-seat coupe or convertible form. With sleek lines and compact dimensions, the F-Type remains a head-turning sports car everywhere it goes. It also has the horsepower to back up those good looks thanks to a supercharged V-8 that delivers 444 or 575 horsepower; the latter figure is reserved for the top-of-the-line R coupe and R convertible, both of which have all-wheel drive. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jaguar F-Type?\n\nThere are no significant changes to the F-Type for 2023.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jaguar F-Type Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n10-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12.3-inch digital gauge display\nAdaptive suspension\n20-inch wheels\nLimited-slip differential\nActive exhaust system\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jaguar F-Type?\n\nBased on its looks and performance, the Jaguar F-Type is certainly worth consideration alongside potent rivals like Porsche’s 718 Cayman and 718 Boxster, as well as the Chevrolet Corvette and BMW Z4. It’s delightful to drive and boasts a lusty exhaust note, but the F-Type also features a dated basic design, snug cabin and limited cargo space.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Jaguar’s updated 2021 F-Type R is even better-looking than before, and it delivers a winning mix of luxurious comfort, sports car performance and knockout style.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s less expensive but no less capable than rivals like the Porsche 911 and Mercedes-AMG GT, and it maintains its own traditional feline styling; the new Chevrolet Corvette, however poses a value and performance challenge to the Jaguar — as it does to every other sports car on the market.\n\nAsk any auto enthusiast what the best all-around sports car in the world is, and there’s a good chance you’ll hear the Porsche 911. For decades, the 911 has been the global benchmark for enthusiasts looking for a precision driving experience. But what do you buy if you’re looking for a sports car that’s a little different than that, one that’s still rewarding but maybe has a bit more passion to its styling, a bit more rarity to its presence, one you don’t see a dozen of at track days?\n\nMight I suggest the 2021 Jaguar F-Type? It ticks all the boxes a 911 does — rear- or all-wheel drive, two doors, two seats, coupe or convertible, powerful engine — and throws in something the 911 has typically left as an afterthought: an absolutely gorgeous body. For 2021, Jaguar has updated that body and a few other notable features, so we took one for a weeklong spin to see if the F-Type really is a suitable alternative to the comparatively ubiquitous Porsche 911.\n\nRelated: 2021 Jaguar F-Type Video: A Cat Changes Its Stripes (a Little)\n\nDespite the fact that the Jaguar brand isn’t one of the higher-selling nameplates in the world of luxury automobiles, it still commands a certain respect and cachet. Its historical mystique is powerful, allowing the brand to draw on decades of racing success, style leadership, technological innovation and a reputation for “glamour.” That’s why people will mob you when you show up anywhere in a Sorrento Yellow Ultra Metallic F-Type R coupe like the one I drove, whether you’re rumbling your way into a gas station, a drive-thru window or your local cars ‘n’ coffee gathering. And why wouldn’t they? There’s a lot in this new F-Type to love, and it all starts with that sensuous bodywork.\n\nFew Cars Look Sexier\n\nIt looks a little different for 2021: Jaguar has redone the front end to give it a lower, wider, more horizontal look. Gone are the tall headlights stretching up into the fenders, replaced by slim cat-eye lenses that bring the F-Type more in line with the styling of Jaguar’s sedans. The sculpted fenders are still present, as are the muscular rear haunches evoking the whole feline image of the F-Type, first started when the stunning Jaguar E-Type appeared on the market nearly 60 years ago. New taillights adorn the rear, featuring the LED “chicane” signature Jaguar uses on the I-Pace electric car. The new headlights and grille, combined with a curvaceous rear, looks for all the world like the new Ferrari Roma — so if the valet brings you the wrong car after dinner at your fancy local steakhouse, you’ll know why.\n\nMaybe it was the searing yellow paint, but my week in the F-Type turned far more heads than the last Porsche 911 I drove. Perhaps the Porsche’s relative styling anonymity appeals more to those looking to please themselves, while the Jag’s buyer places as much emphasis on style as substance.\n\nKeep It in R Mode\n\nBut what kind of substance is the F-Type packing? There’s a selection of powertrains to choose among, ranging from a spunky 296-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder and 380-hp, supercharged V-6 to what powers the R: a 575-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8. It’s mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission that powers all four wheels; all-wheel drive is standard on all models except the four-cylinder. The R trim I tested brought all sorts of hopped-up parts to the party in addition to that bigger engine that now makes 25 more hp and 14 more pounds-feet of torque than it did for 2020. \n\nJaguar says this engine is good for a 0-60 time of just 3.5 seconds — and I believe them, given how often I enjoyed exploring the engine’s power. The car features something Jag calls Intelligent Driveline Dynamics control technology, which integrates things like the AWD’s torque distribution, dynamic stability control software, continuously variable electronic dampers, brake-based torque vectoring and revised electronic steering to adjust the F-Type R’s various driving characteristics.\n\nKept in its normal mode, this big cat is rather relaxed, playing the role of a sedate grand touring coupe with a burbling exhaust note and calmer shifts that allow for brisk but not overpowering acceleration. I did find the steering to be oddly sloppy in normal mode, constantly requiring corrections at highway speeds as I wandered all over my lane. The calibration of the steering in normal mode is simply too loose and overboosted; it requires less effort but also means the driver feels less control. A quick and simple remedy for that is to simply flick the mode selector into R mode, which transforms the F-Type into a much more sporty-feeling coupe with far more precise steering feel and control, plus ride quality that’s firmer but not at all punishing.\n\n2021 Jaguar F Type R | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\n\nThis is the setting that wakes the F-Type up and makes you think it’s a suitable rival for the 911. Acceleration is explosive, accompanied by a glorious roar from the adjustable exhaust and a screaming whine from the supercharger. Attacking your favorite twisty road in this car is a joy, as all its electronic systems come together with newly revised springs and anti-roll bars to create a truly enjoyable sports car experience. Grip is tremendous thanks to staggered-size Pirelli P Zero tires that are 10 millimeters wider than the old tires, wrapping beautiful matte-gray 20-inch wheels. The car’s R mode can also be customized, which is what I did: Keeping the steering in its most aggressive stance but allowing “normal” operation of the suspension and powertrain created an all-around sporty yet compliant sports coupe that was a joy to drive. You just have to remember to switch on the configuration whenever you start the car, which really isn’t much of a burden.\n\nBeautifully Finished Interior\n\nSo it’s got style, it’s got substance — but how’s that interior? Jaguar has been something of a mixed bag in that department as of late, sometimes lacking materials quality, usable technology and sensible controls. The F-Type’s interior hasn’t changed much for 2021, but there are a few new features of note. First of all, the materials quality is top-notch these days. The R model has beautiful quilted Windsor leather performance seats, high-quality plastics, real metal trim and some new display technologies for 2021. A new, fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster is standard and can be reconfigured several ways, even allowing for a full navigation map if desired. It also changes when you change driving modes, with different schemes that can be linked to different modes.\n\nThe multimedia system is the latest version of the Jaguar/Land Rover Touch Pro system, displayed on an easy-to-reach 10-inch screen. It feels faster than it has, with quicker changes between screens and a more intuitive layout — but still no ability to engage a “beep” confirmation sound when you touch the screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, or you can use Jaguar’s native apps for controlling your personal electronic device. There’s still some interior quirkiness with the Jag, however, such as central climate control vents that rise up from a hidden position whenever the dash vents are engaged. My immediate thought regarding these (and the exterior door handles that pop out from their flush position when you unlock the car) was: “Oh, well, these are going to break eventually.”\n\nElectronically actuated climate vents are an unnecessary gimmick in what is otherwise a beautifully finished but unremarkably styled interior. There’s more artistry and comfort in here than you’ll find in a Porsche 911, with more luxurious materials, as well, but the 911’s rear-engine layout also makes for better forward visibility than you get in the F-Type. Of course, there is something to be said for gazing out over the Jaguar’s shapely hood, knowing it covers the beating heart of a true powerhouse of an engine.\n\nThe seats are appropriately sized and comfortable, perfectly adjustable and covered in some truly nice leather in higher trims. There’s plenty of headroom in the F-Type, even with the glass roof panel; it’s a fixed panoramic roof, not an openable moonroof, but it at least has an opaque sliding cover, not a translucent screen like some cars have. I would have preferred an interior in a color other than black — but then, choosing a Sorrento Yellow F-Type with the Mars Red leather option would make it look like Ronald McDonald’s staff car. (Tan and Light Oyster are also options.) The coupe’s trunk is not big; you’ll be able to stuff a roll-aboard suitcase or a couple of soft-sided duffels in there, but the ubiquitous golf bag might be a stretch — and you can forget about a full-size suitcase. \n\n2021 Jaguar F Type R | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\nNot the Most Expensive Cat on the Block\n\nAs befits a luxury brand’s sports coupe, the F-Type doesn’t come cheap — even the basic four-cylinder model. The cheapest F-Type rings in at $62,750 (all prices include destination). The V-8-powered F-Type R starts at a whopping $104,350, to which my test car added $4,550 for its special yellow paint, $1,175 for the fixed panoramic glass roof, $1,125 for a climate pack, $1,100 for 20-inch wheels, and a host of smaller options, bringing the grand total to $115,135. If you go nuts and specify every option possible on a convertible F-Type R, you can easily top $137,000 — more than twice as much as a base F-Type coupe costs. \n\nThis is par for the course in this class. The cheapest 911 starts at $100,550, and it only goes north from there (rapidly). Lower trim levels of the Jaguar F-Type match up more favorably in price to cheaper Porsches, like the 718 Cayman coupe and Boxster convertible, but once you get into V-8 F-Type R territory, the 911 is a better matchup. Mercedes-AMG’s GT coupe starts at $116,895 but easily matches the Jag in style, cachet and sheer outrageousness. And of course, we’d be remiss in not mentioning the sports car bargain of the century: the newest Chevrolet Corvette, a mid-engine C8 Stingray. It significantly undercuts every other player in price, yet still brings an astonishing mix of supercar styling, everyday usability, available luxury trimmings and trackable fun to the party.\n\nThe changes Jaguar made to the 2021 F-Type have only furthered the coupe’s desirability in my opinion, enhancing its style and presence while maintaining excellent sporting performance chops and providing an eminently viable alternative to the Porsche 911.\n\n2021 Jaguar F Type R | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "New all-wheel drive gives a welcome dose of sure-footedness to the 2016 Jaguar F-Type, a stylish performer that any luxury sports-car shopper should consider.\n\nThe two-seat F-Type comes in base, S and R trims, as a coupe or soft-top convertible. Compare them here. The base and S have a supercharged V-6 good for 340 or 380 horsepower, respectively. Last year’s 495-hp V-8 S convertible is now the R convertible, and it gets the same 550-hp, supercharged V-8 as the R coupe. A newly available manual transmission on V-6 models rounds out the major changes. Stack up the 2015 and 2016 F-Type here.\nExterior & Styling\nIt’s a testament to the F-Type’s styling that the car, entering its third model year, still elicits stares from passers-by. In the parking lot, one shopper whipped out his phone to snap a photo of our test car. At the park, a bicyclist shouted approval as he pedaled past. My wife notes that only men, not women, took notice; wealthy bachelors may want to take up guitar or cooking instead.\n\nI doubt you’d need the F-Type R we tested — $128,695 as equipped — to get such reactions. The base F-Type costs about half that and looks essentially the same. Higher-performance versions add some minor ground effects, larger standard wheels (20s versus 18s), relocated hood vents and different tailpipes. Contrast that with sports cars like the Porsche 911, base versions of which look a world apart from the top form.\nHow It Drives\nThe F-Type R’s 550-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 unleashes immediate, violent power to all four wheels. It’s an intoxicating rip toward redline as the car storms forward; every open road is just another excuse to hammer the gas. Jaguar says it goes from zero to 60 mph in just 3.9 seconds, a hair faster than last year’s rear-drive F-Type R.\n\nA six-speed manual transmission is now available on rear-drive V-6 models. The vast majority of F-Types will get the car’s eight-speed automatic, but it’s far better than some of the eight-speed gearboxes from Jaguar and its sibling brand, Land Rover. Upshifts are seamless; multi-gear downshifts come with little delay. Even in regular Drive, the F-Type R is a quick shifter, though one editor notes it’s still not as good as Jaguar’s excellent six-speed autos, which the brand has phased out.\n\nA Dynamic mode quickens drivetrain response even more and dials out some power-steering assist. It also turns the F-Type’s exhaust note into a veritable buzz saw, but you can turn that off with a separate switch.\n\nThe new all-wheel drive, standard on the F-Type R and optional on the S, has a clear rearward bias. Hammer the gas as you go into a corner and it’s easy to induce a nice drift before the stability system reels the tail back. In sweeping curves, our tester’s Pirelli P-Zero summer tires (P255/35ZR20 up front, P295/30ZR20 in back) delivered outstanding grip even on wet pavement, but you should swap them for all-season or winter tires if your winters are cold, especially if there’s ice or snow. Even with all-wheel drive, summer tires are a dangerous choice when temperatures drop.\n\nOne editor noted that all-wheel drive seems to add a degree of understeer in the F-Type R, but it isn’t objectionable. The car’s nose still (mostly) hugs its course as the rear creeps out ever so slightly on steady throttle. It still gets squirrelly when you really mash the gas, but the threshold is much higher than in last year’s rear-drive F-Type R. The steering is sublime, with excellent feedback through the full turn but enough low-speed power assist for easy maneuverability.\n\nRide quality is fairly good, all things considered. There’s some up-and-down rhythm on undulating highway stretches, but the F-Type damps out bumps with minimal brittleness. Dynamic mode alters firmness for the adaptive suspension, too, but it’s hard to notice the changes.\n\nLesser trims have either a fixed or adaptive suspension with unique suspension tuning (base, S or R); the S gets a limited-slip differential, while the R has an active, torque-vectoring differential. To learn more about the drivability of either V-6 F-Type, read our review of the 2014 model here.\nThe Inside\nLeather surfaces swarm the interior, and it’s enough to distract from some of the harder, lower-rent textures below waist level. Lower trim levels lose some of the eye candy, as Jaguar packages the F-Type’s leather-wrapped dashboard with optional high-performance seats in upper trims. (The standard seats have smaller bolsters; power adjustments are standard across the board.) Our test car’s performance seats had good adjustment range, with a few inches left over for my 6-foot frame.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe climate and stereo controls sit close, with shortcut buttons or large dials for all major functions. Compared with the glacial response from Jaguar’s past multimedia screens, the F-Type’s system zips through menus but still lacks a radio-tuning knob. A navigation system and Meridian audio with Bluetooth phone/audio and USB/iPod connectivity are standard.\nCargo & Storage\nUnlike some other sports cars, the F-Type lacks a cargo shelf behind the front seats to throw a small bag. (The Porsche 911 has an actual backseat, though it’s really a glorified cargo shelf. Still, storage is storage, and the Jag doesn’t have it.) At 11 cubic feet, the F-Type coupe’s trunk can fit a roller suitcase or some golf clubs, but the convertible’s trunk is just 7 cubic feet, and it’s awkwardly shaped at that. Retracting the roof doesn’t interfere with the cargo room, at least.\nSafety\nThe F-Type has not been crash-tested, and because of its low sales volume that’s unlikely to change. See all its standard safety features here. Note that although a blind spot warning system and automatic high-beam headlights are optional, the F-Type does not offer forward collision or lane departure warning systems.\nValue in Its Class\nJaguar expanded the F-Type’s bumper-to-bumper warranty for 2016 to an impressive five years or 60,000 miles, with complimentary maintenance throughout that entire span. That’s an impressive policy, and it mitigates some of our concerns over build quality from past F-Types we’ve driven (read about them here). Our 2016 test car had no major issues.\n\nAn F-Type R can run well into the six-figure range, but the base F-Type coupe starts under $70,000. It’s a fairly complete car at that price, thanks to more standard features for 2016, among them fully power-adjustable seats (last year’s were partially manual) and the top-spec Meridian audio system. And even the base car hits 60 mph in a plenty-quick 5.1 seconds (5.5 with the manual), according to Jaguar.\n\nThe V-6 F-Type offers the biggest bang for the buck, with head-turning styling and sufficient power and luxury to match. Kick it up a notch and the F-Type R is a raucous alternative to other six-figure sports cars. Three years in, this Jaguar has aged well. Luxury sports-car shoppers should add it to their list.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Jaguar F-Type?\nThe Jaguar F-Type is a luxury sports car that’s offered in coupe and convertible body styles with a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. It seats two and is powered by a standard 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. A supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 rated at 340 or 380 hp and a supercharged V-8 rated at 550 or 575 hp are available. All engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Porsche 911 and Mercedes-AMG GT.\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Jaguar F-Type?\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is now standard along with front parking sensors. A new Checkered Flag Limited Edition version features special badging, leather and suede interior trim, performance seats, a red center marker at the top of the steering wheel, a black roof and 20-inch gloss-black wheels.\nWhat Features in the 2020 Jaguar F-Type Are Most Important?\nNewly standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto improve the car’s connectivity, and the wide range of engines means there’s likely a powertrain that’s right for you. Available all-wheel drive can help extend the driving season for both coupe and convertible versions.\nShould I Buy the 2020 Jaguar F-Type?\nThe F-Type offers good handling, powerful V-8 performance and a comfortable cabin. Rear visibility isn’t great and neither is cabin storage, but if you’re looking for an entertaining sports car, the F-Type is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Jaguar F-Type?\n\nThe Jaguar F-Type is a luxury sports car that’s offered in coupe and convertible body styles, with a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. It seats two and is powered by a standard 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. A supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 rated at 340 or 380 hp and a supercharged V-8 rated at 550 or 575 hp are available. Competitors include the Porsche 911 and Mercedes-AMG GT.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Jaguar F-Type?\n\nAll F-Types now have the InControl Touch Pro multimedia system, which gets minor changes this year. Lane keep assist, emergency braking and a driver-drowsiness monitor are now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Jaguar F-Type Are Most Important?\n\nIf you prefer shifting gears yourself, you can still get a manual transmission; a six-speed manual is available with the F-Type’s supercharged V-6 engine, along with an eight-speed automatic transmission (the other engines only team with the automatic). Available all-wheel drive can help extend the driving season for both coupe and convertible versions.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Jaguar F-Type?\n\nThe F-Type offers good handling, powerful V-8 performance and a comfortable cabin. Rear visibility isn’t great, and neither is cabin storage, but if you’re looking for an entertaining sports car, the F-Type is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "The hottest kitten on the road just got a little nip and tuck for 2018, with Jaguar unveiling the 2018 F-Type coupe. In addition to some mild styling updates, the big news for 2018 is the addition of a new, lower-price base model powered by a four-cylinder engine.\n\nExterior\nThe changes are subtle but meant to help people distinguish the different F-Type models apart from a distance. New full LED headlights are standard, and changes to the bumpers and air inlets are different for each trim of the F-Type now. The rest of the design remains unchanged from the previous (and still gorgeous) original design. New R-Dynamic and limited-edition 400 Sport models also join the range, bringing the count to five: F-Type, F-Type R-Dynamic, F-Type 400 Sport, V8 F-Type R, and V-8 F-Type SVR. The 400 Sport will be a single model year only, and feature special badging and limited paint colors.\n \nInterior\nThe interior gets some new brightwork and trim, but not much changes design-wise. The big news are new slimline seats made from lightweight cast magnesium alloy and available in either Sport or Performance variants, with the Performance models featuring more aggressive bolstering. Sport is standard on the F-Type and R-Dynamic, while the 400 Sport, R and SVR get the Performance models. The Siena Tan leather color that was previously only available in the SVR is now available across the range. The 400 Sport gets some unique interior trim as well, with yellow accent stitching, embroidered 400 Sport logos in the head restraints, and more badging on the steering wheel and sill plates.\n \nA new in-vehicle camera app called ReRun, developed in conjunction with GoPro, allows drivers to record their drive with a hood-mounted GoPro camera and overlay the video with vehicle performance data gleaned from the car’s systems. The video can then be uploaded to social media via a smartphone interface in the car’s multimedia system, so drivers can share their journey or track experience with friends. The concept is similar to the Performance Data Recorder found in the Chevrolet Corvette and Camaro, but it relies on the user’s own camera equipment that syncs with the car instead of a camera built into the rearview mirror housing.\n \nFor 2018, Jaguar has also made the InControl Touch Pro multimedia system standard across the F-Type line-up.\n \nUnder the Hood\nThe most interesting news for 2018 is a new powertrain: The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder Ingenium engine makes 296 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. Its output is good enough to zip the F-Type from zero-to-60 mph in 5.4 seconds, according to Jaguar, and tops out at 155 mph. Strangely, it’s only available with an eight-speed automatic transmission — the manual is not available on the four-cylinder.\n \nThe other two powertrains — the supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 and supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 — remain unchanged, but the Sport 400 special edition gets a slightly more powerful version of the V-6. It’s putting out 400 hp instead of the standard 340 (380 in the R-Dynamic model).",

      "expert_review": "What’s the best sound you’ve ever heard? Not the best-sounding car, just the best sound — period? Your favorite band, live in concert? The laughter of a beloved child?\n\nWhatever it is, it doesn’t sound half as good as the 2017 Jaguar F-Type SVR at full chat. Almost nothing compares to the sound of that glorious, 575-horsepower, supercharged V-8 roar. It’s a symphonic cacophony, as if the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl were skillfully banging away on a dozen aluminum pots that reverberated off your skull and shook the depths of your soul. It’s that good.\n\nBut how’s the rest of it? Is the Jaguar F-Type just a British fuel-to-noise-converting V-8 wrapped in voluptuous curves? Or is it any good to drive? We spent a week with Jag’s top cat — and even got a little track time — to see if it’s more than just a pretty face with a sultry voice.\n\nStill Gorgeous After All These Years\n\nWe first saw the new Jaguar F-Type’s shape in the C-X16 concept car in 2011, and the look has carried on practically unchanged since production started in 2013. That’s perfectly OK; this remains one of the most beautiful cars on the road. Its feline shape is perfectly matched to the brand: It’s pumped up and muscular — sheet metal stretched taut over components, making for a car that’s both aggressive and beautiful.\n\nJust about any car in this category, be it a coupe or convertible, is going to be good-looking. The Mercedes-Benz SL roadster is classy and formal, while the Porsche 911 embodies nostalgia. The Chevrolet Corvette is the raciest among them. I almost prefer the fixed-roof Jaguar F-Type coupe, however, with its longer roofline arc that accentuates the car’s length. But there are certain audio benefits to being able to drop the top.\n\nThe Most Sultry Voice You’ve Ever Heard\n\nThe biggest benefit to lowering the top is that it removes the barrier between your ears and the tailpipes. Stomp the accelerator, and the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 growls to life with one of the best sounds in the automotive pantheon. But it’s not just noise the 575-hp, 516 pounds-feet of torque that motor generates, it’s thrust — and loads of it. There are many trim options availible on the F-Type, and you can have your choice of all-wheel or rear-wheel drive on many of them. You have your choice of convertible or coupe on all trim levels. However, the two top end trims, the Jaguar F-Type R and SVR, are only available with AWD.\n\nThe massive engine is remarkably flexible. Around town it’s quiet, docile and calm, but push the active-exhaust “loudener” button, which opens the cat’s pipes, or slip it into Sport mode, and the fireworks begin. The engine pops and snarls from exhaust backfire even under partial throttle, but it really turns heads when you ask it for more range-topping grunt.\n\nThe best format to keep the SVR in is Normal mode with the exhaust button depressed. This gives you aggressive but not overly darty steering, a firm but not punishing ride, and throttle response tuned for around-town ease instead of instantaneous, track-oriented responses.\n\nPutting the SVR in Sport mode out on the street is unpleasant. It feels too high-strung, too eager to pounce to be able to drive it smoothly. But put that kitty on the track, as I did at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis., and the magic shines through.\n\nThrottle response is instantaneous. Power is never building, it’s always just there, right now, ready for you to use. Jaguar reports a zero-to-60-mph time of just 3.5 seconds for the SVR, and I have no reason to doubt that figure whatsoever. The brakes never fade; they’re strong and silent as they haul you down from heart-pounding speeds in seconds. The transmission, so smooth and seamless on its shifts around town, responds to paddle shifts instantly, as well. It all works so well that there isn’t any one area to point to and say, “this really needs improvement.” On the street or on the track, the Jaguar F-Type SVR is outstanding to drive.\n\nBut then, so are its competitors. The Mercedes-Benz SL550 is the one you go after if you’re looking for luxury and grand touring style, with its well-damped moves and isolating ride and handling. The Porsche 911 out-handles the F-Type, even in SVR trim, and provides far more communicative steering to let you know what the car is doing. The rear-wheel Corvette Z06 is the same way — brutal power and no forced induction, proving that sometimes there’s just no replacement for displacement.\n\nInner Beauty\n\nThe Jaguar F-Type’s good looks are not just skin-deep; they extend to the interior, as well. The SVR is the top-of-the-line trim level, so it’s loaded with Alcantara (faux suede), bright chrome, carbon fiber and aluminum bits.\n\nIt feels like you sit low in the Jaguar F-Type, but that’s an illusion — the car is just very high-waisted, so it’ll feel like you’re sitting in a tub when you’re actually at a normal height relative to the rest of traffic. It makes it impossible to put your arm up on the windowsill, and it does impact visibility somewhat. Looking to the front is fine, but seeing out the sides and rear quarters is rather difficult. A wind blocker between the roll-bar hoops obscures your rearward view with its semi-opaque screen.\n\nIt might sound like tight quarters, but when you’re surrounded by such sumptuous materials, you won’t mind being so cocooned. Nor will you mind spending time in the seats, which are special SVR sport ones — heavily bolstered but highly adjustable. The entire experience is one of a super-premium, upscale luxury car, in which one doesn’t need to search for justification of its price.\n\nIt’s nicer than the inside of a 911, which is more of a spartan, purpose-built sports car, but the F-Type interior doesn’t quite match up to the opulence of a SL550 (though it’s really close). The Corvette’s interior is definitely better than it used to be, but it’s still built to a much lower price, which is reflected in the materials and components it shares with lesser Chevys.\n\nPlenty of Tech, Just Not the Safety Kind\n\nJaguar’s multimedia system, InControl Touch, is functional, easy to use, clear and fast. There’s no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay feature, but you won’t miss them, as Jaguar’s software works quite well. It’s a step above the Porsche system and easily as sophisticated as Mercedes-Benz’s tech, and it looks classier than the Chevrolet MyLink system in the Corvette.\n\nThe rest of the interior gadgets also work well. The organic light-emitting diode displays in the climate control knobs look very high-tech, and the premium audio system sounds fantastic.\n\nBut while Jaguar does focus attention on some gadgets, it neglects safety technology. The F-Type doesn’t feature common safety items like knee- or side-curtain airbags, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, autonomous braking or adaptive cruise control. And while competitors such as the Corvette likewise don’t feature such systems, vehicles like the Porsche 911 do have some of them. Typical of low-volume sports cars, the F-Type hasn’t been crash-tested.\n\nDon’t Plan on Bringing Much With You\n\nThe only real downside to the Jaguar F-Type’s interior is its lack of usable storage. There isn’t much space in the center console forward of your elbow, and while there’s some to be had in the upper portion of the console between the seats, it’s not easy to access. If you have a big smartphone, finding a place for it may be tricky.\n\nThe trunk isn’t exactly sizable, either. That’s to be expected in a small, two-seat roadster, but among its convertible contemporaries, the SVR is still on the small side, with just 7.3 cubic feet of trunk space. The Porsche 911 convertible has 10.0 cubic feet in its frunk (front trunk), as does a Chevrolet Corvette convertible, while the Mercedes-Benz SL tops them all with a spacious 13.5 cubic feet. So while the SVR has enough room for a couple of duffels or a small roll-aboard suitcase, like its interior, storage space is not abundant in the trunk.\n\nBeauty and Speed Don’t Come Cheap\n\nOne of the great things about the Jaguar F-Type, both the coupe and the drop-top, is that you can get one for a reasonable price. The base convertible starts at $66,395 including destination fee, which is a steal for a car this beautiful with an interior this well done. But the SVR described and pictured here costs a wee bit more — or maybe even double: It’s $129,795 to start and $132,233 as-tested, with carbon fiber and extended leather trim, illuminated doorsills and additional wheel locks. That’s a whole lot of coin (you could buy two base Corvettes with that money), but the car you get is so well executed, so opulent and arrives with so much presence, you won’t question its cost once you’ve driven the first mile.\n\nThe Porsche 911 that competes best with the AWD SVR is the GTS AWD Cabriolet, which is a little more expensive but does everything as well as the SVR. It gives up 125 hp to the V-8-powered Jag, but it’s also more than 300 pounds lighter, so that helps balance the equation.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz SL matches the Jag’s luxurious driving experience, but if you want to keep the cost close, you’ll have to opt for the SL550 instead of the more capably matched AMG SL63.\n\nA gorgeous beast of a machine, the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 convertible surpasses the heavier Jag on the track and allows you to maintain a fuller pocketbook. But while it outguns the Jaguar F-Type, it can’t hold a candle to it when it comes to comparing cockpits. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nAll told, when it comes to pedigree, heritage, knockout styling and kickass performance, the Jaguar F-Type SVR is hard to beat.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
