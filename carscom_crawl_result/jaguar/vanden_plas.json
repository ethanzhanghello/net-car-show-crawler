      "expert_review": "Beautiful, With No Buts\n2004 Jaguar XJ Vanden Plas\n\nThe new Jaguar XJ Vanden Plas is a beautiful car. That much is obvious. Its double-scalloped headlamps, elegantly sculpted door handles and sensuously tapered rear end all catch the eye.\n\nBut beauty carries a penalty. It is the perceived lack of ability.\n\nThere are, for example, beautiful women who have spent their lives proving their intelligence and value as human beings. They labor under a bias that says the Almighty subtracted from their brains what he gave to their bodies. It’s the pretty-but-stupid thing.\n\nThat also happens with cars. Jaguar long has been known for its physical attractiveness. But if you aren’t a racing fan, familiar with the marque’s competence in events such as the Sports Car Club of America’s Trans-Am, you might believe that Jaguars embrace romance but lack passion for running or reliability.\n\nCertainly, quality problems in previous Jaguar passenger models contributed to that thinking. Similar electrical and mechanical difficulties, such as the once-overwhelming smell of gasoline in the passenger cabins of all things Porsche, also plagued other automobiles. But in the hard-nosed, male-stance sports cars, those failures were seen as quirks. In the pretty Jaguars, they were seen as, well, failures.\n\nThe new Jaguar XJ, of which the tested Vanden Plas is one of three versions, rewrites the script. It is classic in terms of beauty and revolutionary in matters of vehicle construction and performance.\n\nLook at that lovely body. Aluminum is in. Steel is out. As a result, the new XJ Vanden Plas — Jaguar is using “the new” for this one, as opposed to “2004 model” — is nearly 200 pounds lighter than its predecessor. Yet, Jaguar engineers claim, the new car is 60 percent stiffer than the previous model.\n\nMuch of that stiffness stems from the way the aluminum structure is bonded together. Jaguar took cues from the aerospace industry. The body components, which are called “pressings” in the auto industry, are joined by self-piercing rivets and epoxy adhesives. Robots apply the adhesives, which are heat-cured for strength. About 3,200 rivets are used in the process.\n\nIncreased body rigidity, coupled with a four-wheel independent suspension system using forged aluminum components, yields substantially improved handling. Although the new XJ is longer, wider and taller than its 1994-born and periodically freshened predecessor, it feels easier to drive than the previous model. It behaves better in curves, changes lanes at high speeds without the slightest hint of tail wiggle. Steering is precise, compliant. The car goes exactly where you point it.\n\nJust watch where you’re going. The new XJ Vanden Plas and its XJ8 and XJR siblings are powerful automobiles. The Vanden Plas and XJ8 share a 4.2-liter, 294-horsepower V-8. The XJR comes with a supercharged, 390-hor sepower version of that engine. The cars leap from 0 to 60 mph — in 6.3 seconds for the XJ8 and Vanden Plas and five seconds for the XJR.\n\nShould you leap into trouble, at speeds between 5 and 10 mph, you are not likely to shatter your bank account as well. Jaguar, in a nod to auto insurance companies, has designed a bolt-on front end capable of taking a 10-mph frontal hit without the car experiencing structural damage. As implied by its name, the bolt-on front end easily can be unbolted and replaced if it’s trashed.\n\nEasy-fix technology also is applied to the doors of the new XJ. Should they be damaged in a low-speed, side-impact crash, they can be lifted off and repaired or replaced.\n\nBut the joy of the XJ Vanden Plas is in the driving . . . and arriving. It is a totally sensuous experience — slipping into the plush, leather-bound interior accented by burled-walnut trim and lambswool foot-well rugs, keying the ignition, hearing the soft moan of the engine, taking off. Invariably, when you arrive at your destination, people stop and stare at the car, you. They smile, nod in approval. It is a good feeling.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaint: I can’t keep it.\n\nPraise: I wish I could keep it. The new XJ is performance art. It is a play or dance well done. You savor being a part of it, if only for a little while. On the practical side, kudos to Jaguar for coming up with a 10-mph bumper system that also looks great.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Superior.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: It’s pretty, and it kicks butt. The car moves fast with grace and authority. Very comfortable ride. Does not lean toward soft and mushy. Excellent handling in the curves.\n\nBody style/layout: The new XJ , which will continue in its “new” iteration for several years, is a four-door sedan with front engine and rear-wheel-drive. It is available as the XJ8 (standard luxury), XJ Vanden Plas (super-luxury), and XJR (sport-luxury).\n\nEngines/transmissions: The 4.2-liter V-8 in the Vanden Plas develops 294 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 303 foot-pounds of torque at 4,100 rpm. Both it and the 390-horsepower version in the XJR are linked to an electronically controlled six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nCapacities: The XJ Vanden Plas sits five people. Trunk space is 16.6 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 22.5 gallons of gasoline. Premium unleaded is required.\n\nMileage: I averaged 26 miles per gallon in the Vanden Plas in mostly highway driving.\n\nSafety: All-aluminum body structure designed to absorb major crash forces, thus reducing crash shock in the cabin; a full complement of passive safety (dual-stage air bags, automatically tensioning seat belts, etc.) and active safety (anti-lock brakes, brake assist, traction control, etc.) devices.\n\nPrice: Base price is $68,995. Estimated dealer’s invoice price is $66,000. Price as tested is $68,995, including a $665 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: An absolutely beautiful car. Compare with Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7-Series, Lexus LS430, Infiniti Q45.",

      "expert_review": "Can you find true love for $70,330? Probably not. But that sum will buy you what might be the perfect Jaguar luxury sedan – a 2005 Jaguar XJ-Series Vanden Plas.\n\nI’ve been over some of this ground before, so pay attention.\n\nI had a week in the 2004 Jaguar XJR in the summer of 2003 and, last fall, I reviewed the 2005 Jaguar Super V8. Like the Vanden Plas, both of those vehicles are part of Jaguar’s potent XJ-series of sedans.\n\nThe XJR and the Super V8 were equipped with super-charged, 4.2-liter V-8 engines with 390 horsepower – enough juice to flatten your nose on hard accelerations. They were great fun, but came at a cost – about $90,000 in the case of the Super V8. What if you want an elegant-looking, head-turning Jaguar sedan for a more reasonable price – something that exudes class, that has substantial pop but not so much that you feel the equal of NASCAR star Jeff Gordon?\n\nLook no further than the 2005 Vanden Plas. Even the name sounds classy, right?\n\nFor trivia buffs, Vanden Plas was the name of a coach-building company that traced its roots back to Belgium in 1870. Over time and company acquisitions, naming rights ended up with Jaguar. Vanden Plas is also the name of a German progressive metal band, but my guess is the sober-thinking folks at the Jaguar plant in Coventry, England, aren’t going there.\n\nAnyway, back to the car. It’s a beauty. Limo-like lines stretch over a lengthy, 124.4-inch wheelbase. The Vanden Plas stretches out to 205.3 inches overall, which translates to plentiful room for five passengers inside.\n\nInside, luxury flows like spring snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nFront seats have 16-way power adjustments. Soft-grain leather and burled walnut surfaces give the cabin the look of a well-appointed den. Thick wool rugs cover the footwells. A 320-watt Alpine audio system can hold seven CDs and serves up concert-hall-like sound quality.\n\nThe rear seatbacks have substantial “business trays” that can be folded down to hold a laptop computer or that light lunch you’ll be enjoying while someone else handles the driving chores.\n\nThe engine is a 4.2-liter, 32-valve V-8, but it’s not the rocket booster found in the Super V8 and XJR. The tested Vanden Plas had a horsepower rating of 294, which was plenty robust for the driving tasks at hand.\n\nIts handling in most driving conditions was velvety, but I was surprised that the nearly 3,900-pound car had some significant sway on high-speed corners and slalom runs.\n\nWhat’s up with that? I hate it when my back seat passenger’s Grey Poupon slides off the folding tray and stains the plush carpet.\n\nAn active suspension, a stability control system and a six-speed automatic gearbox added up to an enjoyable ride, and it was fun to drive. Although body sway raised its ugly head now and then, road bumps were swallowed up before they reached the passenger compartment.\n\nThrough the steering wheel, the Vanden Plas actually feels bigger than it is. I had no problem with it as I like a firm feel in the wheel when I’m driving. Happily, steering response is immediate and smooth, and a short driver easily can handle the chore with the standard power-adjustable foot pedals.\n\nThe tested Vanden Plas came with a somewhat pricey, $2,300 navigation system that took only a little time to master.\n\nOverall, the Vanden Plas provides what you expect from a $70,000-plus investment in a motor vehicle. Performance fans will likely put up more cash for the XJR and Super V8 models, but that’s no knock on the Vanden Plas, which has a more subtle elegance all its own.\n\nAbout the writer: The Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com. 2005 Jaquar Vanden Plas at a glance Make/model: 2005 Jaguar XJ-Series Vanden Plas.

      "expert_review": "The big cat from Great Britain’s Jaguar Cars Ltd., has grown up a little for 1996.\n\nThe new models, the Vanden Plas and the XJ12, are the longest Jaguars ever manufactured, possessing size and wheelbase dimensions carried by full-size American luxury automobiles.\n\n“We’ve had a great deal of interest in the Vanden Plas because of its increased size,” said Scott Fischer of Tom Wood Jaguar. “Our customers have been tremendously impressed by the increased room and luxury.”\n\nWhether Jaguar’s being owned by the Ford Motor Co. had anything to do with it is a matter of conjecture, but the Vanden Plas’s and XJ12’s 117.9-inch wheelbase is comparable to the Lincoln Town Car at 117.4 inches. And at 202.8 inches of overall length, the Jag is in the ballpark of the Lincoln Continental’s 206.3 inches.\n\nIn the realm of British automobiles, these are big motor cars. They also are high-dollar ones, with the V-12 cylinder-powered XJ12 priced at $79,370. The Vanden Plas starts at $64,420, the third-most expensive model of a lineup that also includes the XJ6 ($56,320), the XJR ($66,279), and the XJS convertible ($61,570).\n\nThe Vanden Plas and XJ12 obviously are not designed to appeal to the economy car buyer, but rather to those who need more back seat room for friends, family, or corporate associates.\n\nBlame it on the ’93\n\nThe concept sprung from the 1993 Jaguar Majestic sedan, a model not offered on the American market. This was a limited production, semi-custom car, with much of its body work done by an outside supplier.\n\nThe acceptance of the Majestic prompted the decision to build the longer-wheelbase Vanden Plas and XK12, the only way these models are offered.\n\nOnce the project was given the green light, it took just 15 months to bring the cars to market.\n\nJaguar also took the opportunity to do some upgrading. The rear sound deadening was improved by filling voids with foam. Other improvements included thicker door glass and longer rear springs to enhance the ride.\n\nThe entire job added only 50 more pounds of weight, and Jaguar states that the longer cars are just as rigid as the shorter 113-inch wheelbase XJ6.\n\nThe body and wheelbase lengthening job creates a quantum leap forward in rear-seat leg room, providing an additional 4.5 inches. Modifying the roof has provided an extra half-inch of headroom front and back. If an owner is of Indiana Pacer player dimensions, the sunroof can be deleted, adding yet another inch of headroom.\n\nThere are some other touches connected to the new construction, such as longer rear doors, which provide significantly improved access to the back seat. Then, there is an item that all luxury car makers would do well to examine.\n\nAn electric switch allows rear passengers to adjust the position of the front passenger seat. (Assuming, of course, that the front-seat occupant doesn’t object.) The control switches are located on the inboard side of the front passenger seat back.\n\nIt almost goes without saying that the tradit ional Jaguar amenities are included in the long-wheelbase sedans. Natural grain, premium Autolux leather is included, as are matched wood inlays and matching wooden shift knobs. Both cars have a full line of power accessories and comfort and convenience accessories.\n\nWhat the cars do not share is the same engine.\n\nThe Vanden Plas is powered by Jaguar’s double overhead cam, 24-valve in-line 6, while the XJ12 is named after its single overhead cam (per head) V-12 engine. The XJ12 is one of but a handful of cars made today offering a 12-cylinder engine.\n\n“The 12 is a very specialized type of car,” Fischer said. “It mainly interests someone who wants that particular type of engine.”\n\nAt 366 cubic inches (6.0 liters), it has power to spare at 313 horsepower and 353 foot-pounds of torque. By comparison, the in- line six is rated at 245 horsepower and 289 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe V-12, however, is incredibly smooth and performs yeoman duties as the epitome of a continental to uring en gine.",

      "expert_review": "It is a tough road that Jaguar is driving these days. The automaker’s models are surrounded by bold, powerful sedans, many of which gracefully combine true sporting performance with modern luxury.\n\nEven the 2006 Jaguar XJ Vanden Plas — with 300 horsepower worth of thrust, polished woods, and supple leathers — is going to have difficulty competing.\n\nTo stand out in the luxury class, a car needs an identity that says “Look at me — $60,000, $70,000, and $80,000 of pure rolling fun.” It also needs to say: Here is a car for the new millennium.\n\nAnd that’s where I parked the Vanden Plas in the breakdown lane.\n\nIf you are a fan of the stolid old Jaguar and want its traditional form to also incorporate reliable function — something for which Jaguars were never noted — then the XJ Series may seem promising. But if you’ve got the money to drop nearly $80,000 on a car, you’ve probably also got the smarts to shop around and notice some serious competition.\n\nLook at the bold nose Audi has slapped on its line: a snout right out of the 1930s glory days of Auto Union racing. The new Audi line is immediately recognizable as Audi, and yet it is a far bolder car than what Audi was building just five years ago.\n\nConsider the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. It comes with as much as 469 horsepower (302 horsepower is more the standard) and a sleek, modern, redesigned exterior.\n\nThen glance across the other ocean to the Lexus LS 430, one of the finest, most refined luxury cars on the market, with 278 horsepower and more standard comfort and safety features than you’d ever guess an Asian manufacturer would someday offer.\n\nAlso think about Cadillac’s new edginess and power, and consider that Porsche will offer its first sedan in a few years.\n\nI’ve been driving small cars of late (Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris), so the smooth, quiet cruise of the Vanden Plas was a soothing experience, to be sure.\n\nWith sprawl-out interior room, gracefully sculpted dash lines, burl walnut and boxwood trim, leather seats defined by bold piping, and even fold-down picnic trays in the rear, there was no doubt I was cruising in luxury.\n\nAnd the 300-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 engine had plenty of off-the-line oomph. It got even stronger, with a guttural burble, whenever I pulled out to pass on the highway. The six-speed automatic transmission was smooth, with no delays or lurches in upshift or downshift, and it sensed when I wanted to push the car and let me do so without premature intervention.\n\nJaguar’s use of aluminum in the monocoque body structure was evident in light handling and taut body control. There was no weighty sense of pull to the side in lane changes, or even in sharp corners in the countryside. Active, adaptive suspension was certainly at the heart of this confident stability. And standard ABS and electronic stability control were there to handle any dances that were too close to the edge.\n\nI did manage to engage stability control a couple of times in the flooding rains we had recently. On a corner, or in a deep puddle where hydroplaning was a threat, it kicked in to protect — with the additional help of power and braking — the car and its occupants.\n\nAlso adding protection were the standard front and side air bags and side-curtain air bags.\n\nDespite all these goodies, nothing about the outside of this car says anything except, yep, here’s another Jaguar. That could be a problem.\n\nAmericans tend to feel pumped up about their cars, whether it’s the superior sense of environmental awareness some owners of green hybrids project, the outta-my-way attitude of outlandish SUV owners, or the hot-rod mindset the owner of a retro American muscle car, such as the new Dodge Charger, might adopt.\n\nJaguar has a real problem if a car as fine and wonderfully engineered as the Vanden Plas fails to generate the same level of passion.\n\n2006 Jaguar XJ Vanden Plas\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nBase price/as tested: $74,330/$77,095\n\nFuel economy: 16.7 miles per gallon in Globe testing\n\nAnnual fuel cost: $2,609 (at $3.351 per gallon, premium, 13,000 miles per year)\n\nTHE EARLY LINE\n\nCan what lurks beneath an old reliable skin attract new buyers who are seeking something hot?\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\n\nDrivetrain: rear-wheel drive\n\nSeating: five occupants\n\nHorsepower: 300\n\nTorque: 310 lb.-ft.\n\nOverall length: 205.3 inches\n\nWheelbase: 124.4 inches\n\nHeight: 57.3 inches\n\nWidth: 76.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,819 pounds\n\nNice touch: Dark piping around tan leather seats. Bold and luxurious. Lexus would never dare to do this.\n\nAnnoyance: Looks. What do you gain by putting great new engineering under a high-tech aluminum skin whose shape suggests I could have pushed it off the highway dead from the rain decades ago?\n\nWatch for: Jaguar to offer bold designs or retreat to the jungle, where it will howl for the old days with other lost brands.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",
