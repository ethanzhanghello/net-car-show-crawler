      "expert_review": "A Jaguar is elegance personified, but the all-new S-Type is elegance with an up-to-date twist.\n\nIt is an evocative stew of heritage styling, state-of-the-art chassis and two thoroughly modern powerplants. Toss in a huge helping of high-tech gadgetry, add a few bits of leather upholstery and stained maple veneer and the result is an automobile that is quick and agile, yet tasteful and sublime.\n\nThe name pays homage to the 1960s 3.8 S-type, as does the retro styling. Although Jaguar is owned by Ford Motor Co., the S-Type was designed, styled and developed at Jaguar’s Whitley Engineering Center in Coventry, England. Manufacturing is done at Castle Bromwich, near Birmingham, England.\n\nThe S-Type comes in two models, a 4.0-liter V8 and a 3.0-liter V6. The V6 starts at $43,095 and the V8 begins at $48,595. The basic platform, rear-wheel-drive chassis and a good many mechanical bits are shared with the Lincoln LS. While some kinship is obvious, the cars have distinct personalities.\n\nOur test car was a light, celery-green metallic V8. The aluminum V8, with four valves per cylinder, variable intake valve timing and 281 horsepower, is similar to the one in the XJ8. It is so quiet and smooth that the power comes out in oozes, rather than surges, and that makes it deceptively quick.\n\nThe 3.0-liter V6 puts out 240 horsepower. Although I did not sample the V6 Jag, I have driven a V6 Lincoln LS, whose engine is similar except it has 30 less horsepower, and its performance was more than adequate. Jaguar quotes zero-to-60-mph times at 8 seconds for the V6 and 6.6 seconds for the V8.\n\nBoth engines are coupled to a new, electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission. Except for a bit of whine when pulling away from a stop, this unit was nearly transparent. A console switch lets the driver select Sport or Normal shift modes.\n\nThe J-shaped shift gate is a recent Jaguar tradition, but its shape is confusing to us Yanks because shifting into a lower gear means shoving the lever forward, not back. The test car’s shift linkage was a bit sticky when moving into Reverse.\n\nWhile the exterior styling pays homage to Jags of the 1960s, the interior is considerably more modern. Bird’s-eye maple is used on the instrument panel, shift knob, console, door panels and steering wheel. Nearly everything you touch has that feeling of slick, polished luxury.\n\nThe lower center section of the dash contains the stereo, dual-zone climate control and navigation system. These units are similar to ones found in some Fords, and their tiny, green digital readouts are hard to see in the daylight, especially if the dash is backlit. Readability at night, or in shadow, is fine.\n\nThe test car was equipped with the Deluxe Communication Package ($4,300) that included the navigation system as well as voice activation for the cell phone.\n\nFront seats have good lateral and lumbar support, but the bottom cushions would provide better unde r-thigh support if they were a shade longer or had a slightly different contour. The back seat has adequate legroom for adults, but getting in and out can be tricky because of the sloping roof and tightly curved door. The space between the seat and door post is also small and requires turning one’s leg sharply to get out.\n\nThe trunk has plenty of room.\n\nJaguar describes the S-Type as having ”spirited elegance,” and to that end it uses a double-wishbone suspension with aluminum control arms and speed-sensitive, variable-ratio rack and pinion steering. The optional Sport package has 17-inch wheels and a computer-controlled suspension that chooses “soft” or “firm” settings depending on driving conditions.\n\nOur test car was so equipped, and not only did the 17-inch wheels look great, the computer-controlled suspension gave a ride that was plush enough to dispatch bumps with a silky hand yet taut enough for flat cornering.\n\nAnti-lock brakes and traction control are st dard, but for more control a stability control program that helps counteract skidding is a part of the optional Weather Package.\n\nWith the S-Type, Jaguar has struck an appealing balance between yesterday and today: The styling recaptures so much of what made Jags special in the 1960s, yet performance and handling is on par with contemporary European sedans.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the test car was $48,595. The Sport package and communication package brought the sticker price to $54,010.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nSPECS\n\nPoint: Wonderfully retro styling with a modern touch gives the S-Type a beguiling personality. Sharp handling, quick acceleration and a comfortable ride are icing on the cake.\n\nCounterpoint: The center section of the instrument panel has small, green digital readouts that are hard to read in some daytime lighting conditions, and getting in and out of the back seat can be hard because of the curved roofline.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 4.0-liter V8\nTransmission: automatic\nRear-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 114.5 inches\nCurb weight: 3,770 lbs.\nBase price: $48,595\nAs driven: $54,010\nMpg rating: 17 city, 23 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Jaguar’s S-Type model line gets some major renovations for 2002 as well as the addition of the high-performance S-Type R model. The S-Type, launched in 1999, has softly rounded styling, four headlights and an oval grille that recalls the look of classic Jaguars without being a caricature. It is elegant yet modern, which has led it to become the fastest-selling Jaguar to date.\n\nFor 2002, changes across the model range include a redesigned interior, a V-8 enlarged to 4.2 liters, a bump in the horsepower of the 3.0-liter V-6 to 240 and the addition of a six-speed automatic transmission. Both the front and rear suspension have been redesigned and the body structure is 10 percent stiffer. Overall weight has been reduced by 100 pounds by using aluminum suspension pieces and magnesium for seat frames and the cross-car beam that undergirds the instrument panel.\n\nAll of the above changes enhance the S-Type, but the biggest news is the addition of the supercharged R model, which produces a whopping 400 horsepower vs. 300 for the normally aspirated version. The S-Type R is a natural competitor to BMW’s M5 and the Audi S6. During Jaguar’s introduction of the car to American journalists, I drove the new 4.2-liter V-8 as well as the S-Type R on Virginia’s twisty two-lane roads just outside the nation’s capital. The 4.2-liter V-8, with the optional sports suspension, was delightfully sure-footed without punishing its passengers, even on roads whose surface was pockmarked and rough. The additional displacement of the engine accounts for a wider midrange powerband. It steps lively when you want, pulls eagerly from slow speeds and goes about its business with barely a whisper. The six-speed automatic transmission has a ratio for every situation and it shifts so smoothly you donÕt even notice it.\n\nThe S-Type R looks different because it has a mesh grille, rear spoiler and 18-inch wheels. It sits just a little closer to the ground and has a larger air intake under the front bumper. Driven normally, it feels much like the regular S-Type with a little tighter suspension. Get frisky with the throttle, however, and it covers ground in great bounding leaps. The supercharger’s whine is accompanied by a steady push in the back while the scenery begins to get blurry. Whereas BMW’s M5 feels like a race car on the street, the S-Type R seems to be much less frenetic. Jaguar quotes zero to 60 miles per hour in 5.3 seconds with a top track speed that is electronically limited to 155 mph.\n\nMuch of the S-Type R’s excellent ride quality can be attributed to Jaguar’s Computer Active Technology Suspension. CATS uses upgraded springs so there is less body roll, and the shock absorbers are two-stage, electronically controlled units that change settings while the car is in motion. This enables the ride to be relatively softer at slower speeds and firmer at higher speeds. CATS also switches the the settings of the rear shocks slightly after the front so the car turns into corners better at slow speeds. At high speeds, the opposite happens so the car feels more secure.\n\nIn practice, of course, these minutiae are undetectable, except to say that the car goes where it is pointed with accuracy and confidence. Even with 18-inch wheels, the ride is pliant enough to be comfortable.\n\nInside, a sweep of bird’s-eye maple veneer decorates the instrument panel, which now has a redesigned center console and a 7-inch, LCD touch-screen display for the optional navigation system. The instruments have green dials and new needles. The seats are tailored to each model, with those of the S-Type R having the deepest contours and biggest side bolsters.\n\nFront, side and side-curtain airbags are standard.\n\nOther new items include an electronic parking brake that is activated by a button on the console near the shift lever and electrically adjustable pedals with a memory for two drivers. The electronic parking brake automatically acti ates when the car is put into Park and releases when it is taken out of gear.\n\nThe addition of the S-Type R gives Jaguar a high-performance sedan to compete with the best there is. It not only looks great, but it offers powerful performance in a relatively subtle package.\n\nPrice\nPrices start at $43,875 for the 3.0-liter V-6, $49,975 for the V-8 and $62,400 for the S-Type R.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nThere is no At A Glance box because this is not a regular test drive of a production model.",

      "expert_review": "The Jaguar S-type series, for a shining hour, gets to hold down the spot of flagship in the feline line.\n\nBut the real capo of this family is the XJ series sedan, which, in 2004 form, is just about to roll off the ship and reclaim its rightful place. (Hot tip: If you like – and can find – one of the 2003s, you should be able to get it at about a $7,000 discount. From what I’ve seen of the new XJ, though, you might have buyer’s remorse.)\n\nTo put it in the simplest terms, the S-type, evaluated herein, is a midsize Jag, while the XJ is a roomier full-size. Both are still rear-drive, and comparably elegant.\n\nThe S-type, being about mid-career (launched in 1999), got a freshening for the 2003 model year – a totally-redesigned interior plus new engine and transmission availabilities, as well as significant chassis and powertrain tweaks – a pretty thorough update, as they go.\n\nOutside, it retains the sinuously attractive Jaguar lines and that in-your-face, somewhat controversial, grille treatment.\n\nThe inside, with as much leather and wood per square foot as you’d find in the better men’s clubs, is posh. But am I alone in thinking it was a mistake to change the bird’s eye maple accents from a cognac color to gray?\n\nAt 6-1, I had barely enough headroom and was far from extending my legs full out. Jaguar has donated an inch or two to the rear compartment, which is livable for two adults. The designator S-type spans a fairly wide range, from the low 40s to more than 60K, manufacturer’s suggested. Which class you fall into depends largely on engine choice. The “base” model is the 3.0, a rather Teutonic name for a machine crafted in Castle Bromwich, England, near Coventry.\n\nThe 3.0 of course refers to engine displacement, and is attained by six cylinders arrayed in V form. It produces 235 hp and 216 foot-pounds of torque. Even though the car pushes two tons with a hefty driver, that output is claimed by the factory to be good for 0-60 times in the decent mid-seven-second range.\n\nJaguar and six-cylinder engines have a long history, of course, but the famous ones of days gone by were of inline construction, which is smoother, but less space-efficient than a V.\n\nIf you’re serious about driving this cat, you really should consider the next step up, the V-8 series tested here. I say that not for the second or so you’ll save on the burnout time, but for the wonderful sense of readiness it confers at most any speed.\n\nThe 4.2-liter engine has been tuned for low-end response, with a 310 foot-pound torque max eclipsing the 300 hp it makes, which shows a good appreciation of the fact that we Colonials will likely never use the upper half of the speed range, despite having states that are bigger than the country of the Jag’s birth.\n\nUpon ignition, the V-8 proves a proficient idler, betraying its presence neither by vibration nor noise. The latter attribute changes dr amatically when you step on the Jag’s tail, and run it up to the 6,000 range.\n\nThe sound then is typical of a highly-tuned V-8, slightly menacing. Not that you ever NEED to run to 6,000, since the twisting force peaks around 4,000. Moreover, this year the 4.2 is fitted with a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThat is probably overkill here, with the broad torque band available, but it does no harm except adding another layer of complexity. It might be of more use in the six-cylinder variant.\n\nThe new automatic showed a great deal of street smarts, moving seamlessly from gear to gear in suburban situations almost undetectably, save through the tachometer.\n\nLiking a bit more control, I was glad to see the gearbox can be shifted manually, too. The shifter is console-mounted and arrayed as a U, with the usual P-R-N-D on the right side. From D, you can slide the lever to the left, which puts you in fifth gear. Pushing forward from that point gives you your choice of the four other cogs.\n\nIt’s better than a gated arrangement, where you have to jog the lever back and forth, but I still prefer the simplicity of the style Porsche pioneered as Tiptronic, where moving the lever over to manual control then empowers you to upshift by pushing it forward, or downshift by reversing the process.\n\nFailing that, they should provide a bright LED gear indicator within the driver’s field of vision.\n\nSpeaking of vision . . . the test car had an optional navigation system-cum-central control station for advanced audio and air conditioning functions, too.\n\nThe navigation part is this year DVD-based, which means you can drive coast to coast without switching the street-level mapping disk.\n\nIt’s as good a display as I’ve seen, and though it was ignorant of some minor street names in the Tristate, it did a fine job of positioning the vehicle and selecting a route from A to B. It can be had with voice commands in 17 languages.\n\nI do not like having simple functions such as changing the radio stations buried beneath layers of menus; at least here there are large, well-marked buttons for the discreet functions, such as Climate and Audio.\n\nAs these nav devices percolate down to more affordable machinery, I think we’ll have a collective epiphany about their distraction factor. The manufacturers cover their tails by making you agree, every time you turn it on, not to futz with it too much. It just can’t be good for a driver to have to look over and down and focus on a screen three feet away when her attention should be riveted on the 30 to 300 feet dead ahead.\n\nJaguar says the S-type has a stiffer suspension this year, plus more aggressive shocks and springs. Fear not, the ride is superb. The shocks are two-stage electronically-adjustable, reacting in the microsecond realm to pavement inputs, going from soft to firm in a few degrees’ rotation of the driving wheels.\n\nThe ride over broken concrete at a good clip was particularly impressive in how it filtered out the rude sensations before they entered the cabin.\n\nIt’s not obnoxious, but the tire noise is a bit higher than I’d like in a luxury sedan, even a sporting one. They can be heard at speeds risky and reasonable, although wind noise starts to cover that source when the car goes into a gallop.\n\nThe Jag’s handling is very good, probably as good as it needs to be for the intended audience. Like so many other upscale cars these days, it has stability control, which is supposed to prevent the driver from asking for a harder turn than is, at that instant, possible.\n\nIt worked quite well up to a point, but out there on the edge of sanity, it became a bit intrusive, I thought. I was aware of a lot of negotiation going on when all I wanted was a simple power slide.\n\nI toured the countryside at a pace the numbers said wasn’t as sedate as it felt – a good sign – and pounded federal asphalt a bit harder than the watchdogs prefer, and my mileage was 23.1 combined, quite respectable; premium of course is mandatory. EPA’s estimates are 17 mpg city, 26 highway.\n\nThe brakes, as befits a marque with a racing heritage, were impressive – solid pedal feel and eye-popping deceleration.\n\nGenerously-shod 18-inch alloy wheels on the 4.2 no doubt contributed much to its feeling of stability as well as its dry braking prowess. The front tires are meaty 245/40s, while the rears are 275/35. Those low profiles, as well as the ultra-stiff-sidewall Z rating, speak again to the cleverness of the suspension engineers.\n\nBeing a low-volume car, the S-type has not been crashed by Feds or the insurance folks. I would feel reasonably safe, however, based on the solidity of the chassis as well as the presence of front, side and head-curtain air bags.\n\nI mentioned a third tier earlier – that is an S-type with this same engine, prompted by a supercharger. For a starting price of $62,400, this gets you 400 horses and 408 foot-pounds – just the ticket for unruffled 70-mph touring.\n\nIf I may niggle . . . its strikes me as tacky to advertise the V-8 with chromed exterior emblems. Just give it specific wheels, okay? And what’s with the potmetal face on the ignition switch? My snowblower’s is better conceived.\n\nEdmunds.com pricing surveys suggest you can get $1,000 – $1,500 knocked off the price of an S-type.",

      "expert_review": "This new Jaguar can run with the best of them\n\nSometimes, at the wheel of a certain car on a certain stretch of dry, deserted rural interstate, there comes the urge to get deep into the throttle, prompted by the devilish realization that “I Oughta be on the Autobahn.”\n\nI remember traveling that high-speed public highway from Frankfurt en route to the deathly infamous racetrack, the Nurburgring, where, I thought, the real high-speed stuff would begin. There I was on the Autobahn, however, already at 140 miles per hour, moving quickly to my right to let a Porsche, and then a large S-Class Mercedes-Benz blow by me like I was a hesitant lane-clogger lost in the exhaust of a Sunday drive.\n\nThe flashback hit me recently behind the wheel of an unexpected car: a Jaguar.\n\nAh, but this was not your everyday prowling cat. This was a Jag to chase down a cheetah: the 2004 S-Type R, a hot luxury sedan.\n\nIt is something of a ‘tweener car, not really built to challenge the big muscle of such howlers as the Mercedes-Benz AMG 55 or the BMW M5, yet it ends up running far closer to their performance standards than the sedans of Infiniti or Lexus, the latter being cars from which it was, in fact, designed to pull away.\n\nIt is a long leap from the basic S-Type to this supercharged, rear-wheel-drive thumper, but this cat makes the pounce most nimbly. Whereas the base 4.2-liter engine delivers a respectable 294 horsepower, the supercharged 4.2, dual overhead cam, aluminum V-8 in the S-Type R has 390 horsepower and 399 lb.-ft. of torque. And it provides it to the wonderful whine of the supercharger at maximum throttle.\n\nPerhaps in backing away from the full pedal-to-the-metal approach of the M5 or the AMG 55, the R has a transmission that is a bit more “controlling” than you might expect in a high-performance car. Indeed, the six-speed automatic had a tendency to shift up sooner than an enthusiast would prefer. But that, I suspect, is part of being a ‘tweener.\n\nIt is a trait you can sense, as well, in the ride. The R has a smoother, softer ride than the AMG 55 or the M5, and that’s a good thing, I suppose, for spirited if controlled highway cruising. It lacks the stiffness of the others, however, in cornering and rapid lane change posture.\n\nThe suspension, independent front and rear with aluminum double wishbone setups and stabilizer bars front and rear, is electronically controlled for two stages, depending on driver demand and road conditions.\n\nStopping the Jaguar with a system that seems to get tighter and quicker the harder it is pushed, is a four-channel, four-piston Brembo system with ABS tied to 14-inch-plus discs up front and near 13-inch discs in the rear.\n\nThe ride, smooth on highways, a bit squishy in lane changes, and somewhat undulating on rough roads, still offered a sporty experience. There were slight hints of understeer, but no thing that threatened to become unmanageable.\n\nInside, fine leather seating was firm and tight in a good way. I could do without the gray bird’s-eye maple wood treatment, but I loved the gauge/control setup, with the behind-the-wheel gauges growing a warm green of a winter night, and the center control pod — audio, climate, navigation — framed in a protruding, stitched leather rim. Leg and head room were great, front and rear.\n\nFrom the outside, there’s no mistaking this as a classic Jag, with the oval mesh grille; muscular, slanted front fenders; sloping rear roof; and chopped rear deck.\n\nThis is a very quick, fast car — 0 to 60 mph in just over 5 seconds, electronically limited to 155 miles per hour. And that’s at just over two tons of curb weight. I wonder how this cat would run if the steel body was replaced with the aluminum Jaguar is turning to in other models?",

      "expert_review": "We’ve tested a number of exotic European sport sedans this year, with such arcane alphanumeric designations as RS4 and M3. Our favorite nameplate — and one of our favorite high-performance four-doors — is Jaguar’s S-Type R.\n\nA supercharged V-8 with 400 horsepower is only the jumping-off point for this appealing member of Ford’s British luxury-car stable.\n\nWe tested a 2006 S-Type R with only two options and a bottom line of $66,645.\n\nSHE: Normally, I dread testing these expensive performance cars. Nine times out of ten, I feel like they’re controlling me, not vice versa. But despite all the scary numbers on the Jag — the 400 horses, the 413 pounds-feet of torque, 0-60 acceleration in 5.3 seconds — I felt completely at home and at ease in the S-Type R. It’s easy to drive, it’s gorgeous and, I dare say, is more geared toward women than competitors from Audi and BMW.\n\nHE: I probably shouldn’t admit this publicly, but I’ve always liked the exterior lines of the S-Type. The mesh grille in the R edition fits nicely, too, without giving the car an overly macho look. Probably my biggest issue with the S-Type is that the cabin has always felt a little snug on my six-foot, 225-pound torso, and that goes for both the front and the rear seats. But dynamically, the car is terrific — suspension, brakes, steering are all top-drawer. Hard to believe that Lincoln never did have much success with the S-Type’s mechanical twin, the LS.\n\nSHE: Talk about scary numbers — I had no idea you weighed that much. Sounds like you could use some of the same aerodynamic sculpting that Jaguar applied to the S-Type R. There are a few things I disliked about the car. The front doors are too large, incredibly heavy and difficult to reach to close. I found it annoying that the $450 Sirius satellite radio was not incorporated into the main audio panel. The cabin is a little too black and monochromatic for my taste, too. I like the gray birds’-eye maple wood trim, but it seemed a bit much when paired with the charcoal-gray leather. Still, I would rather see wood than carbon-fiber trim, especially if I’m paying luxury-car prices.\n\nHE: The R edition is all about the engine, and it is simply sensational. The supercharged 4.2-liter V-8 is hair-trigger responsive, and the six-speed automatic gearbox seems well-suited to handle its power and torque. It would be fun to see Jaguar do an all-wheel-drive version of this car, but be forewarned that the rear-drive S-Type R will likely be a real handful in wet weather and on icy winter roads.\n\nSHE: The fuel economy is also pretty mediocre. We got 17 miles per gallon in city driving and 23 mpg on the highway. And, like most performance cars, the Jag only takes premium fuel, which was well over $3 a gallon when I refueled it in late August. On the plus side, the S-Type R has outstanding safety features, including stability control — which will help on slippery roads — as well side curtain air bags that protect all outboard passengers and side air bags for the front-seat occupants.\n\nHE: One refreshing thing about the S-Type R is the exceptional assembly quality — much better than we’ve seen on expensive Jags in the past. On the downside, the digital display in the center console is way too fussy and looks too cheap for a vehicle in this price segment.\n\nSHE: I worry that the beautiful lines, including that sculpted hood, will turn off male buyers who are just looking to make an in-your-face statement about power and muscle. This is no Cobra, guys. But if you want the best of all worlds — performance, elegance and refinement — the S-Type R is one of the most appealing packages out there.\n\n2006 Jaguar S-Type R\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.\nPrice: Base, $63,995 (incl. $665 shipping charge); as tested, $66,645.\nEngine: 4.2-liter V-8; 400-hp; 413 lb-ft torque.\nEPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway.\nWhere built: England\nEstimated 12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $2,023\n\nAnita Rating: 4\nLikes: Completely different personality from German sports sedans like Audi RS4. More geared toward women. Love the dark wood trim. Easy to handle, easy to park. Great safety features.\nDislikes: Front doors are large, heavy, hard to reach to close. Backlight looks like it’s shared with the Ford Taurus. Only takes premium fuel. Cabin is too black/monochromatic. Optional Sirius satellite radio not integrated into audio panel.\n\nPaul Rating: 4\nLikes: Sensational supercharged engine. Smooth six-speed automatic. Active suspension provides firm, controlled ride. Outstanding brakes.\nDislikes: Seats don’t fit my butt. Too much fussing with digital display. Cramped rear compartment.\n\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Detroit-based automotive information services company.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 2008 model year will be the last for the S-Type, as Jaguar plans to replace it with the XF in 2009. Jaguar left most of the S-Type unchanged for 2008, choosing just to tweak a few exterior features and leave the drivetrains alone.\n\nPositioned between the company’s compact X-Type and full-size XJ in size and price, the S-Type comes in three versions with distinct engines: a 3.0-liter V-6, a 4.2-liter V-8 and a supercharged V-8 for the S-Type R.\n\nJaguar’s 4.2-liter V-8 turns out 300 horsepower, while the supercharged R delivers 400 hp. Like other Jaguar models, the S-Type gets a chrome mesh grille. A Conti-Teves foundation braking system promises improved stopping distance and pedal feel. Bluetooth wireless technology is available.\n\nExterior\nThe major changes for 2008 are to the S-Type’s exterior. The 3.0 and 4.2 versions now share the S-Type R’s front bumper. All S-Types now ride on wheels that are an inch larger than before, at 18 and 19 inches.\n\nDisplaying a round Jaguar badge, the grille incorporates horizontal vanes and slim vertical chrome vanes. Round taillamps help display what Jaguar calls a “more technical look [and] more presence.”\n\nMesh inserts are fitted in place of fog lamps in the S-Type R to allow air to reach the car’s twin oil coolers. The R edition also features a trunk spoiler, twin tailpipes and Jaguar’s Enhanced Computer Active Technology Suspension, which uses adjustable dampers. The R models feature standard xenon headlights with automatic self-leveling.\n\nInterior\nBoth the 3.0 and 4.2 versions of the S-Type get leather-trimmed seating and burl walnut veneers in the cabin. For 2008, 3.0 and 4.2 versions have a Satin Edition that features mahogany veneers, a leather steering wheel and shift knob, and limited exterior colors.\n\nFive occupants fit inside all S-Types, and the driver faces chronograph-style dials. Dual-zone climate control and an electrically adjustable steering column are standard. Satellite navigation and Front Park Assist are optional, while rain-sensing wipers and Reverse Park Control are standard. Adaptive cruise control is available as a stand-alone option on the S-Type R or as part of a luxury package. The electric parking brake features an incline sensor. Adjustable pedals were standard in 2007 models but have been dropped for 2008.\n\nUnder the Hood\nJaguar’s 3.0-liter V-6 produces 235 hp, and the 4.2-liter V-8 generates 300 hp. The supercharged V-8 in the S-Type yields 400 hp. All three versions use a ZF six-speed automatic transmission. Traction control is standard.\n\nSafety\nIn addition to side-impact and side curtain airbags, the S-Type features Jaguar’s Adaptive Restraint Technology System. Antilock brakes include emergency brake assist, and Dynamic Stability Control is standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nRoad behavior is especially appealing in the S-Type R, but all models deliver a refined motoring experience. Acceleration with the R’s supercharged engine is smooth and easy, sending the sedan to passing speeds promptly and effortlessly.\n\nBody lean in curves is barely noticeable. The S-Type R stays as flat as any reasonable sedan owner could want. Ride quality beats many performance sedans, though stiffness can be noticed when passing over some holes and bumps. On slightly wavy pavement, the ride is smooth. Some tire noise is apparent on certain road surfaces. The seats are snugly bolstered and highly supportive, though cushioning in the S-Type R seems a tad below par.",

      "expert_review": "Ford bought Jaguar in 1989 — yes, it has been that long — but it wasn’t until 1999 that the company really put its brand on Jaguar, with the introduction of the 2000 S-Type sedan. The S-Type shared bits and pieces with the underrated Lincoln LS, and though both vehicles were better for the partnership, Jaguar loyalists doffed their tweed driving caps and lifted a snifter of brandy to what was Jaguar, and what was now a Jaguar built by Ford.\n\nAll that doffing and snifter-lifting may have been premature, because Ford, for all its problems, has been a pretty sensitive caretaker. Those of us who have been doing this for a while recall the grim pre-Ford period in which you were taking a chance if you depended on a Jaguar test car to get you home. One colleague still talks about climbing into a new Jaguar and closing the door, and having the inside door panel fall on him.\n\nThose days are gone, and though Jaguar will likely never approach Lexus in build quality, the cars are, overall, pretty durable. The S-Type is now in its eighth model year, and though a replacement for the car is in the pipeline, this current version still works. The last update, in 2005, did not change the looks dramatically, which is fine since the S-Type design has attained moderate classic status.\n\nThe top-of-the-line S-Type model is the S-Type R, which has a 4.2-liter V-8 that has been supercharged to 400 horsepower, 100 more than a regular V-8-powered S-Type. If power isn’t that important to you, a base S-Type has a 3.0-liter, 235-horsepower V-6 that is, really, more than adequate for any situation, especially because it has the same intuitive six-speed automatic transmission as the V-8 versions.\n\nStill, Jaguar built much of its reputation not just on design and luxury, but on performance. The S-Type R not only has the horsepower, but it has larger 18-inch tires and wheels — our test car actually had optional ($1,200) 19-inchers — as well as a rear spoiler, a different exhaust system and a sophisticated suspension Jaguar calls CATS, or Computer Active Technology Suspension. That contrived acronym means that the S-Type R’s suspension immediately adjusts itself, per computer input, to speed, road conditions and situation.\n\nSuffice it to say the S-Type R is fast and corners very well, but those drivers looking for pure performance may be happier with a BMW or a Mercedes-Benz AMG model. The S-Type R in the past felt like a luxury car that was made to perform, rather than a genuine performance car. That still applies to the 2007 model but doesn’t take away from the lovely, comfortable interior that no one, BMW and Mercedes included, does better than Jaguar.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJaguar’s midlevel sedan gets a full redesign for the 2005 model year. Changes to the S-Type are considered subtle yet comprehensive, resulting in what Jaguar calls a “cleaner, leaner, more muscular look.” External revisions include a crisper front end and “bolder, more athletic rear proportions.”\n\nDetroit’s 2004 North American International Auto Show saw the first appearance of the 2005 S-Type. Aluminum is used for the new hood, and according to Jaguar, panel fits are considerably tighter. Jaguar made the S-Type more rigid for diesel-engine applications in Europe, and the American version benefits from that process.\n\nFor the first time on the S-Type, the interior can be trimmed with a high-tech aluminum fascia rather than with traditional wood trim. Aluminum is available with the supercharged S-Type R and the Sport Package.\n\nPositioned between the compact X-Type and the full-size XJ, the S-Type went on sale in May 2004. Three versions are available, and all have distinct engines: a 3.0-liter V-6, a 4.2-liter V-8 or a supercharged V-8 for the S-Type R. An automatic is the sole transmission; the manual-gearbox option for V-6 models has been dropped. A luxury VDP model has been added for 2005. The S-Type competes against the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS 300/GS 430 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nExterior\nThe S-Type’s new grille is lower than before, and it sits more upright. Displaying a new round Jaguar badge, it incorporates slimmer vertical chrome vanes, as well as horizontal vanes.\n\nThe new aluminum hood has been reshaped, and the front bumper has a simpler appearance. The rear fender, bumper and trunk lip have been raised. Round taillamps help display what Jaguar calls a “more technical look” and “more presence.”\n\nMesh inserts are fitted in place of fog lamps in the S-Type R to allow air to reach the car’s twin oil coolers. The R edition also features a sporty mesh-patterned grille, a trunk spoiler and twin tailpipes.\n\nThe suspension has been modified to include retuned dampers and low-friction ball joints. The S-Type R gets Jaguar’s Computer Active Technology Suspension, which uses adjustable dampers. The available Sport Package for non-supercharged sedans includes an upgraded suspension and brakes. Five types of alloy wheels are available, and 17-inch tires are newly standard on the 3.0 model. Optional xenon headlights have automatic self-leveling.\n\nInterior\nLike its predecessor, five occupants fit inside the redesigned S-Type, and the driver faces chronograph-style dials. The sedan may have heated power front seats with a memory feature, dual-zone climate control and an electrically adjustable steering column. Satellite navigation, adjustable pedals and rain-sensing wipers are optional. Front Park Assist and Adaptive Cruise Control are also among the options, but all S-Type sedans have Reverse Park Assist. The new electric parking brake features an incline sensor.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree distinct engines are available for the S-Type. The 3.0-liter V-6 produces 235 horsepower and 216 pounds-feet of torque, versus 294 hp and 303 pounds-feet of torque for the 4.2-liter V-8. The V-8 in the S-Type R is supercharged and yields 390 hp and 399 pounds-feet of torque; that’s sufficient to yield a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 5.3 seconds. All three versions use a ZF six-speed-automatic transmission. Traction control is standard.\n\nSafety\nIn addition to side-impact and side curtain-type airbags, the S-Type features Jaguar’s Adaptive Restraint Technology System. Antilock brakes include Emergency Brake Assist, and Dynamic Stability Control is standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nRoad behavior is especially appealing in the S-Type R, but all models deliver a refined motoring experience. Acceleration with the R’s supercharged engine is smooth and easy, sending the sedan to passing speeds promptly and effortlessly.\n\nBody lean in curves is barely noticeable. The S-Type R stays as flat as any reasonable sedan owner could want. Ride quality beats many performance sedans, but stiffness can be noticed when passing over some holes and bumps. On slightly wavy pavement, the ride is smooth. Some tire noise is apparent on certain road surfaces. The seats are snugly bolstered and highly supportive, though cushioning in the S-Type R seems a tad below par for truly soft comfort.",
