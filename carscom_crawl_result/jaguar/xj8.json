      "expert_review": "Of all the cars I get to test drive, the ones I look forward to the most are Jaguars. It has to do with what Sir William Lyons tried to capture in the marque he created: “Grace, pace and space.”\n\nJaguar is a sexy mix of sleek style, impeccable road manners, effortless speed and gracious accommodations.\n\nWhile the entry-level X-Type has been disappointing in this regard, the S-Type, XJ and XJR all feel like the real deal.\n\nSo the thought of a new XJ platform being overseen by the cost-conscious Ford Motor Co. was cause for trepidation.\n\nThen I saw the car.\n\nWhile the front end was reassuringly familiar, the new XJ’s larger size, and higher stance lacks the lithe look of the older car. From the rear door on back, it resembles a Buick LeSabre.\n\nThe looks may be lacking in the posterior, but there’s little doubt the rest of the car lives up to the legend.\n\nFord has gone to great lengths to modernize a car whose previous architecture dated to the disco era. The new XJ uses an equally new platform mated to a lightweight all-aluminum body. The body uses rivet bonding and adhesives in its construction, just as in the aerospace industry. The result is a body that is 60 percent stiffer, yet 40 percent lighter than the old XJ body.\n\nThat helps keep this big cat light on its feet.\n\nThere are a variety of XJ trim levels. The standard car, the XJ8, is equipped with an aluminum 4.2-liter V-8 rated at 294 horsepower.\n\nMated to a new ZF 6-speed automatic transmission, that’s good enough to sprint to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds.\n\nThe XJ8 also is available in a long-wheelbase version, the XJ8 Vanden Plas, mated to the same powertrain. If you need a quicker kitty, you’ll want to opt for the XJR, which takes a sporting approach to the standard XJ8. This includes replacing the standard V-8 with a supercharged version of the 4.2-liter V-8. At 390 horsepower, this car reaches 60 miles per hour 1.3 seconds sooner than the standard car.\n\nNot that you’d really notice.\n\nBoth the XJ8 and XJR feel plenty quick on their feet. The supercharger’s whine and slightly quicker response is the only difference that most people will notice. That means most will find the XJR’s $74,995 base price harder to swallow than the XJ8’s $59,995 base price.\n\nIf $59,995 sounds more like a nice yearly salary than the base price of a car, realize that the XJ8 starts at $13,325 less than the Mercedes Benz S420, one of Jaguar’s key competitors.\n\nCertainly from a performance standpoint, there’s little to complain about and much to praise.\n\nThe 2004 Jaguar XJ8 and XJR continue to deliver the superb, cat-like reflexes and luxurious ride without a feeling of floating. It’s certainly more fun to drive than most of its competition.\n\nYet something has been lost.\n\nIn recent decades, these large cats expertly balanced the handling side of the equation wi th a suppleness that coddled its occupants. Some of that suppleness has been lost. Where bumpy roads were once handled with dispatch, they now register with a firmness that’s unseemly for a cat from Coventry.\n\nAdditionally, both a Jaguar XJ8 and XJR pulled to one side under heavy braking. This was worrisome in the two different samples I tested and bears looking at if you test drive one. Otherwise, performance is what you’d expect.\n\nInside, the cabin continues to deliver the luxurious accommodations that Jaguar buyers expect.\n\nThe folks at Ford have done an expert job of updating the traditional Jaguar look that is accented with yards of leather and burled walnut veneer.\n\nAll the “mod cons” are here as well, including a self-leveling air suspension, electronic brake assist, anti-lock brakes, 12-way power front seats, dual zone automatic climate control, and a fine 140-watt eight-speaker audio system.\n\nOpt for the XJR and Jaguar adds the supercharged V-8 along with a performance suspension, Brembo brakes, 19-inch Z-rated performance tires, power folding mirrors, front and rear heated seats and a heated steering wheel.\n\nBoth test vehicles boast the same spacious cabin and spacious trunk (which was large enough to hold two close friends.) This is where the slightly bloated styling pays dividends, as the old model had a tight back seat.\n\nIn addition, the new car is taller, so entry and exit to the passenger compartment isn’t as difficult as in the old car.\n\nThe one thing that is more difficult to deal with is the parking distance control.\n\nThis sensor emits an audible warning to the driver when his car is about to meet unexpectedly with an object. The problem is over-sensitivity – warning the driver too early and often. If the driver turns it off, it resets to the “on” position every time the car shuts off. Really, if you can’t park this car without electronic aids, you shouldn’t be driving at all.\n\nThe only other quibble is the hood ornament, aka “the leaper.” It is placed far back on the hood. Obviously, this is done so the driver can see it. But looking at the car from the front, it appears misplaced.\n\nOverall mileage was about 18 mpg, including some highway driving. The XJ8 requires premium fuel.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nEven if the car does look like a fat cat, Jaguar still delivers a sports sedan performance that is as entrancing as it ever was.\n\nThe 2004 Jaguar XJ8\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter DOHC, 294-horsepower V8\n\nTransmission: 6-speed ZF automatic\n\nTires: P235/55R17\n\nWheelbase: 119.4 inches\n\nLength: 200.4 inches\n\nWidth: 73.2 inches\n\nWeight: 3,803 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 16.6 cubic ft.\n\n0-60 mph: 6.3 seconds\n\nTop speed: 121 mph\n\nBase price: $59,995\n\nAs tested: Not available\n\nEPA rating: 18 city, 28 highway\n\nTest mileage: 18 mpg\n\nFuel type: Premium\n\nBuilt in: England",

      "expert_review": "Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario – The three letters from Jaguar owners all leveled the same criticism of the car’s heated seats: They don’t work in hot weather.\n\nThis poses a particular problem after an afternoon at the local hunt club and a vigorous horseback ride. It seems that even in scorching weather, working backside warmers would be a welcome touch when you’re spending upwards of $70,000 on a luxury car.\n\nAlas, a thermal cutoff renders the heater in the seats useless when the weather outside gets above 70 degrees.\n\nYears ago, that little nugget might have made its way into an F. Scott Fitzgerald story (he did point out that the rich are different from you and me). But it only seemed to amuse the Jaguar brass on the launch of the 1998 XJ-series sedans, which go on sale Thursday. If that’s all new owners have to complain about, the Ford Motor Co.-owned British automaker is in good shape.\n\nActually, Jaguar is in great shape. And make no mistake: The cars we drove are definitely not just Ford products. They’re genuine Jaguars whose DNA is unquestionably British.\n\nThe Jaguar executives on this trip talk about former Jag owners like Vatican observers describe lapsed Catholics. There is a strong desire to get those people back in the fold. Those former owners should be happy. The 1998 models seem true to the marque’s racing-and-romance heritage.\n\nIt’s somewhat of a small miracle that the ride-and-drive event in this ritzy enclave of spas, specialty shops and the Shaw Festival is taking place. Had George Bernard Shaw, the acid-tongued Irish dramatist whose plays draw people here nightly, been alive and writing about cars, he might have been tempted to say that the Jaguar’s survival in the early part of this decade was “not bloody likely.”\n\n“We were virtually bankrupt in 1989,” says Russell J. Reynolds, president of Jaguar of Canada. “We lost around $400 million in 1990. We wouldn’t have survived at all if Ford hadn’t gotten involved.\n\n“But our turnaround has been equally impressive. We’ve been profitable for the last two years and we’re now in a position to fund our own product development. Our objective is to bring something to the marketplace every year as opposed to every 10 years.”\n\nBy the millennium, Jaguar lovers may see the addition of smaller, more affordable offerings and maybe even vehicles that veer away from the car’s rear-wheel-drive heritage and into new areas like all-wheel-drive. (Of course, Jaguar officials note that they are merely studying these possibilities at the moment – nothing is cast in stone.)\n\nToday, Jaguar’s newfound health is reflected in improvements in its J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction index and the company’s warranty costs.\n\nIn 1989, Jaguar ranked a dismal 31st in the J.D. Power CSI survey. In 1997, it rebounded to the number 5 position. Warranty costs are down 60 percent, reflecting the discipline imposed by Ford’s stricter busines s processes. For example, at least 80 miles of obsolete assembly line were torn out of the ancient Jaguar facility at Browns Lane, England, and replaced with state-of-the-art machinery.\n\nA more business-like atmosphere in the factory has also become the norm. As Reynolds points out, it was not unusual to find Jaguar assembly workers sipping tea at their posts in the late 1980s. Today, they have their Earl Gray and Darjeeling in the plant’s cafeteria.\n\n“Customers have always rated dealers high, but the main dissatisfaction with the product was the product,” Reynolds said.\n\nWe had a little bit of a start, then, in the parking lot of the Queen’s Landing Inn, as we set out for a morning in the 1998 Jaguar XJ8 sedan. The sedan’s trip reset button, which seems too small to begin with, jammed and couldn’t be pried out. But as it turned out, that was just about the only complaint of a day that included turns in the sedan and its supercharged companion, the XJR.\n\nThe XJ odels are the successors to the XJ6 sedans. As the numeral “8” in the name indicates, the big news for this year is the addition of Jaguar’s twin-cam 4.0-liter V-8 engine to the mildly revised series. While the engine’s displacement is virtually the same, the V-8 delivers more power. The XJ6 engine was rated at 245 horsepower, while the new eight-cylinder makes 290 horsepower. While the company says EPA numbers are not yet available, they expect the mileage numbers to be high enough that the cars will manage to avoid the expensive gas-guzzler tax.\n\nCost-conscious luxury buyers will be happy to hear that Jaguar is not increasing prices for 1998. Base prices range from $54,750 for the XJ8 to $63,800 for a Vanden Plas and $67,400 for an XJR.\n\nThe other notable additions to the ’98 lineup are standard side air bags and a revamped suspension.\n\nYou’ll have to look twice to notice any styling changes, but they are there, largely in the form of ovals. Where the old sedans had square forms – in touches like interior wood trim, turn indicator and fog lights – the predominant shape on the new models is ovoid.\n\nEngineers insist this was not a paean to the classic Ford navy-blue oval logo, but just a general overall “softening” of the inside and outside lines of the cars. Of course, the signature Jaguar grille and four-headlight front have not changed noticeably.\n\nInside, the quirky “elephant ear” controls, which were located behind the steering wheel and were hard to see, have been moved. Located on the steering wheel of the ’98s, in a sensible and easy-to-use layout, are controls for the headlights, washers, wipers, telephone and cruise control.\n\nThe stereo system at first seems cluttered with more buttons than previous models, but there is a method to the madness. If you buy the optional, dealer-installed telephone, the audio buttons can also be used as a telephone keypad. This takes cell-phone use in the Jaguar to the next level. While the phone can be voice-activated, you can also use the keypad if you reach voice-mail and need to enter an extension number by hand.\n\nSteering has been improved and the suspension is fluid. Driving the 370-horsepower XJR through the countryside around Niagara-on-the-Lake, with its nine local wineries, was a joy. The effect feels as smooth as a long, flowing strand of silk thread. But as other speed-loving drivers demonstrated, the XJ-series cars seem to deliver qualities that might seem mutually exclusive: Performance and refinement.\n\nMaybe that’s a mystery that only the horsey set, with its intimate knowledge of thoroughbreds, completely understands.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRedesigned for 2004, the seventh generation of Jaguar’s rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan was longer, taller and wider, and rode a longer wheelbase than its predecessor. The new XJ delivered greater headroom, legroom and shoulder space. New aluminum-intensive construction promised high strength, robustness and dynamic responses.\n\nAn extended-wheelbase XJ8 L joined the group for 2005. A long-wheelbase Super V8 flagship with posh Vanden Plas features and a supercharged V-8 also became available.\n\nFor the 2006 model year, a limited-edition Super V8 Portfolio long-wheelbase sedan takes over the top spot. Models with the 4.2-liter V-8 get a boost to 300 horsepower (400 hp when supercharged). All XJ models gain a Conti-Teves foundation for increased stopping power, laminated side glass, a chrome mesh grille and available Bluetooth wireless connectivity. A tire-pressure-monitoring system and driver-selectable Variable Speed Limiter are standard, while Sirius Satellite Radio is optional.\n\nJaguar’s lineup also includes a regular XJ8 and a high-performance XJR.\n\nExterior\nOverall, the XJ sedan has a slightly more cab-forward profile than pre-2004 models, with the wheels brought closer to the corners. The front overhang was shortened, and the windshield isn’t as steep. Oval headlights flank a grille made up of intersecting bars.\n\nA self-leveling air suspension and Jaguar’s Computer Active Technology Suspension system are standard. Regular models are 200.4 inches long overall and have a 119.4-inch wheelbase, while extended-length sedans have longer rear doors and measure 205.3 inches long overall on a 124.4-inch wheelbase.\n\nInterior\nEach XJ sedan seats up to five occupants. A higher roofline in this generation helps increase interior space, and all models have power front seats and leather upholstery.\n\nPower-adjustable pedals complement an electronically adjustable steering column. An electronic parking brake is installed. The interiors are trimmed in traditional burl walnut veneer and Piano Black finish. Vanden Plas sedans contain fold-down picnic tables.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn normally aspirated form, Jaguar’s 4.2-liter V-8 now produces 300 hp. XJR and Super V8 models hold a supercharged 400-hp version of the V-8. All models use a six-speed ZF automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nIn addition to an occupant-sensing system for the front passenger seat, the XJ has side-impact and side curtain-type airbags. Four-channel antilock brakes incorporate emergency brake assist. A Dynamic Stability Control electronic stability system intervenes as needed to enhance handling. Reverse Park Control is standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe elegant, effortless XJs are more enjoyable on the road than most large sedans. Driving pleasure is augmented by genteel comforts and a smooth, refined powertrain.\n\nPassing and merging acceleration falls short of ferocious, but civilized responses make up for any lack of all-out performance. Downshifts on upgrades are easygoing but not instantaneous. Although the XJ is very quiet, its lush exhaust note approaches a snarl when pushed hard. These sedans corner well, but body lean is noticeable during relatively vigorous driving. The air suspension absorbs the vast majority of road imperfections. Front occupant space is abundant, but some controls aren’t intuitive.\n\nThe XJR and Super V8 add an extra helping of vigor, but it’s not always evident in ordinary driving. But push hard on the pedal, and acceleration approaches breathtaking levels and the supercharged powertrain reacts potently after a brief delay. Jaguar’s automatic transmission seems eager to get from one gear to the next and doesn’t diminish the driving experience. The supercharger emits a rich-yet-subtle whine even during moderate acceleration. Added tautness in the XJR’s suspension is evident, but ride quality doesn’t suffer much.\n\nWith the new Super V8 Portfolio edition, you’re paying for exclusivity more than extra features or performance. It’s quick and wholly refined, but the total driving experience differs little from a regular Super V8. Bright power vents on the front fenders look almost like add-ons and might not appeal to everyone.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJaguar’s XJ is the marque’s flagship sedan, and it competes with the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes S-Class and Audi A8. The XJ comes in XJ8, XJ8 L, Vanden Plas, XJR, Super V8 and (new for 2009) Super V8 Portfolio models. As before, regular and extended-length versions are available.\n\nNew for 2009\nNavigation and a surround-sound system are standard across the model lineup. The XJ also gets a new high-end model called the Super V8 Portfolio.\n\nExterior\nIn front of each front door is a chrome gill that Jaguar calls a “power vent.” They echo the slats in the XK coupe. In back, a chrome strip spans the width of the trunk.\n\nThe XJ’s all-aluminum structure is a rarity even in the luxury segment, where many cars utilize a heavier steel frame. Exterior length is 200.4 inches, and it’s 73.2 inches wide. Stretched models add about 5 inches in overall length. The XJ is the narrowest sedan of its competitive set, but it’s among the longer sedans in the class.\n\n19- or 20-inch wheels\nAuto-dimming power, heated side mirrors\nAcoustic laminated glass\nBi-xenon HID headlamps with headlight washers\nAuto-leveling headlights\nFront and rear fog lamps\n\nInterior\nThe XJ’s interior is simple and elegant, if not as opulent as the high-tech cabins in the S-Class and 7 Series. The trunk has 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space, which is tied with the 7 Series as the most in the class.\n\nLeather-trimmed seats and dash\nAvailable burl walnut or elm interior trim\n320-watt, 12-speaker surround-sound system\nNavigation system\nBluetooth wireless technology\nHeated front and rear seats\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nOptional rear fold-down picnic trays\nOptional heated steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\nStandard running gear includes a V-8 engine coupled with a six-speed automatic transmission. A supercharged version of the same engine powers the XJR, allowing the vehicle to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in just 5 seconds. The XJ’s air suspension remains the same. It can automatically lower the car and maintain its balance for the best mix of performance and comfort.\n\n300-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 with 310 pounds-feet of torque\n400-hp, supercharged 4.2-liter V-8 with 413 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nAdaptive suspension\nSpeed-sensitive steering\nSport-tuned suspension with viscous limited-slip differential (XJR)\n\nSafety\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nActive front head restraints\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAntilock brakes with traction control\nElectronic stability system\nBreak-resistant glass",

      "expert_review": "Jaguar’s press materials say the XJ8 is “the bedrock upon which the Jaguar of today is based.”\n\nConsider that the top 2007 XJ8 is available with a 400-horsepower, supercharged V-8 and the brand has a solid foundation indeed.\n\nThis long and low all-aluminum sedan looks like luxury personified. It’s the kind of car that makes you feel rich just by stepping inside. Thick wool carpet, wood inlays and glove-soft leather coddle the passengers, especially those in back where the legroom is generous. Add the DVD screen in the back of each front-seat headrest and trays that pull down from the back of the front seat like in an airliner, and you’ve got a car that is almost as comfortable as a limousine.\n\nMy wife and I took another couple to dinner, and it was hard for our friends not to utter an “ooh” or an “aah” every time they got into the back seat. The XJ could easily be used as an executive limousine.\n\nStyling is a Jaguar trademark, and while some could argue that the XJ doesn’t look as modern as some of its competitors, it has an Old World elegance that seems fitting for the brand. The dual headlights, bold grille and long profile are all typical for Jaguar.\n\nThe XJ was new in 2003, and its aluminum body is state of the art. It is constructed of sheet aluminum riveted and bonded to aluminum extrusions and aluminum castings. Aluminum saves weight, and weight is the enemy of performance. This sedan is 60 percent stiffer than the previous model, and it has improved crashworthiness, according to Jaguar. A lighter car is faster, uses less fuel and emits fewer emissions. This car is at least 440 pounds lighter than the last generation.\n\nThe supercharged V-8 puts out power with the even flow of an electric motor. This big cat is fast, but it never feels as if it is hurrying.\n\nThe XJ starts at $63,585 with a 300-horsepower, 4.2 liter V-8. The long-wheelbase model begins at $67,085. The top-of-the-line Super V-8, which I drove, begins at a whopping $91,335.\n\nThe XJ’s cabin has a fairly low roofline, and that can feel confining to tall drivers. The instrument panel uses a large LCD center touch screen for audio and navigation. This system is not quite as user-friendly as simple dials, but there isn’t room for knobs and the navigation screen both. Voice-activation of some controls is most handy.\n\nThe gearshift has a J-shaped shift pattern that is peculiar to Jaguar. The electronic parking brake comes on each time you put the car in park.\n\nRide quality is excellent, especially considering the low-profile tires and a suspension that has been buttoned down to cope with 400 horsepower.\n\nThe trunk space is generous, too.\n\nSafety features include side-curtain airbags, stability control, tire-pressure monitoring, adaptive cruise control, anti-lock brakes and traction control.\n\nPrice The base price of the test vehicle was $91,335. Destination charges brought the sticker price to $91,535.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles, with a six-year, 70,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "OK, so it’s true. I’m an unabashed Anglophile, at least where automobiles are concerned. Everything from MG and Triumph to Aston-Martin and Rolls-Royce, from Sunbeam Rapier to Humber Super Snipe, I just dig them. British motorcycles, too.\n\nAll-American car guys, go ahead and laugh.\n\nBut no one can mock this week’s offering from Coventry, England. It’s the Jaguar XJ8 L, a lovely and spirited automobile exuding heritage and upper-crust sensibilities.\n\nActually, not much of Jaguar’s big sedan heritage remains, for better or worse. Some new stuff comes from Ford, which now owns Jaguar. Some changes are mandated by time and technology.\n\nGone is the classic double-overhead-cam straight six with its direct lineage to Jaguar sports cars and race cars of the ’50s. It has been replaced by a silky-smooth V-8, also found in the smaller S-Type sedan and wonderful XK8 sports-touring car.\n\nAlso gone is the XJ’s beautiful old interior with its squared off panels of lacquered wood and funky, classic gauges and switches. Instead, the XJ8’s dashboard and door panels have been modernized with softy-contoured surfaces and ovoid shapes reminiscent of Lincoln or Mercury.\n\nThankfully gone is Jaguar’s notoriously quirky electrical system, spotty brake hydraulics and other quality-control problems. Jaguars now get top ratings for quality from consumer groups.\n\nFord’s dollars did help improve the breed, certainly more than Ford’s influence harmed it.\n\nThe test XJ8 was the long-wheelbase version, a U.S.-only model with a back seat big enough for the fussiest passengers, even the Queen Mum herself. The additional five inches is noticeable in the longer rear doors.\n\nDespite its bulk, the XJ8 L (for “long”) is an enjoyable drive, cornering nicely and fending off road irregularities with a suspension that is pliant but not too soft. The big Pirelli tires grip like epoxy. The steering is appropriately responsive.\n\nThe view over the hood is lovely, the familiar contours accentuated by the classic Jaguar mascot leaping ahead. The current body, restyled a few years back, successfully captures the flavor of the original XJ6 that had been lost in the previous revision.\n\nThe V-8 is very appropriate for this car, giving it a relaxed smoothness and plenty of pulling power, at least once under way. Off the line, the modest low-end torque equates to slow acceleration until the two-ton Jag gathers up its skirts and starts to run. In the lighter S-Type and sporty XK-8, the small V-8 exhibits sharper performance.\n\nFor those who need a big power rush, the XJR version of the flagship sedan packs a supercharged version of the same V-8 that packs a whopping 370 horsepower and will blow the doors off most so-called muscle cars.\n\nWhile the exterior styling remains fresh and distinctive, the interior lacks any semblance of Jaguar character. It’s without the broad wooden surfaces and classic gauges that recalled either a tony men’s club o r a Rolls-Royce. The current gauges are green and luminescent and look all the world as if they were lifted from a Taurus. Even the cat face in the center hub is merely embossed vinyl instead of gilded metal.\n\nStill, the cabin is comfortable and well-appointed with a full range of electronic features. Options on the test car were a navigation system, $1,500; premium stereo, $1,000; and heated seats, $500.\n\nDespite the toned-down interior, the XJ-8 is still a true thoroughbred, expensive and exclusive. It’s also equipped to compete with today’s rich crop of luxury cars and uphold one of the most admired marques in motoring.",

      "expert_review": "I’m not really sure why the 2005 Jaguar XJ8 L — with “L” standing for “long wheelbase” — looks so big. The wheelbase and body are lengthened just 5 inches over the regular XJ sedan, but for some reason, the car recalls one of those cartoonish stretched-out Hummer or Lincoln Navigator limousines.\nThe XJ8 L almost looks like that, but not quite. And it certainly doesn’t drive any differently from the regular XJ, which is a good thing, because the new-for-2004 XJ is one of the best-behaved luxury sedans on the roa d. The extra length seems to go exclusively to rear-seat legroom, where 6-footers can cross their legs and stretch out, even with a couple of other 6-footers sitting in the front seats.\nThis is not to say the regular XJ isn’t roomy, because it is. The XJ8 L is just roomier. But unless I frequently had rear-seat passengers whom I genuinely wanted to make comfortable — a rich and ailing uncle, for instance, who needed the room and the neat aircraft-style flip-down table to prepare his will — I can’t think of any reason to get the extra-length XJ. Regular, poor uncles, which are the only kind I seem to have, would be plenty happy in a standard XJ.\nThe reason why the XJ8 L looks so long is because it is. Overall length is 205.3 inches, making it the longest car in the premium sedan class — 2.2 inches longer than the lengthened version of the Mercedes Benz S-Class, and 1.8 inches longer than the longest BMW 7-Series. It is also 6.4 inches longer than a Cadillac Escalade SUV.\nWhen I first wrote about the new XJ in August 2003, my central, and lone, complaint was the styling. The 2004 XJ, while brand-new under the skin, looks oddly like the car it replaces.\n“It’s a classic style,” countered one Jaguar executive then, “and did not require much update.” Well, maybe, but you’d think when a company updates its flagship sedan for the first time in nine years, they’d want it to look like a new car. But that’s my personal opinion.\nThe test car was a Jaguar XJ8 L Vanden Plas, which is the most deluxe model, but not the most expensive: That would be the Super V-8, which is similar to the Vanden Plas, but instead of a 294-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8, it has a 390-horsepower supercharged version of that engine. That car starts at $89,995, making the starting list price of the test car, $70,330, seem slightly less likely to give you terminal sticker shock. Shipping, a $675 xenon lighting package and a $2,300 navigation system upped the total price to $73,505.\nReally, you don’t much need the 390-horse engine. The six-speed automatic transmission does such a competent job of maximizing the regular engine’s 294 horsepower that you are never at a loss for acceleration. The engine is silky-smooth and quiet, too. Handling is very good, especially given the XJ8 L’s size, and the ride is excellent.\nJaguar continues to excel in interiors. The creamy leather and wood trim — burl walnut veneers with Peruvian boxwood inlay — is gorgeous. Instruments and controls need some work, but they always have in this car.\nAside from the too-familiar looks, the XJ remains a delightful car, and the L just gives you slightly more of it.\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s TV reports air Wednesdays on Central Florida News 13.",

Doubtful.\n\nWould it be a Christmas dream come true? Most definitely.\n\nAudi TT Roadster\n\nIt didn’t take long for Audi to turn its one-time concept car into a permanent head-turner. It took even less time to make it a stunning ride.\n\nIt might not win a race in the quarter-mile. It might not be the most comfortable touring car. And it might not be the truest expression of outright sports sizzle, but you can’t deny this about Audi’s little roadster: From the first turn of the key, it draws unparalleled interest from standers-by.\n\nGawking becomes sport. Finger-pointing becomes fun. And it’s all OK because, with the TT, it’s par for the course.\n\nAvailable with five- and six-speed transmissions, the TT is an exercise in euphoria. Its 1.8-liter, 20-valve turbo four is available in 180 or a six-speed 225 horsepower.\n\nBut it’s so much more than that. From the aluminum twin-hoop roll bars, to optional saddle-tan leather seating and a power-operated wind deflector, the TT roadster might be based on the Volkswagen Golf platform, but it’s so much more. With aluminum tinges throughout, an unconventional setup inside and a throwback-style seat position (that makes you believe you’re sitting in a bathtub), the TT is simply terrific.\n\nThere are less-expensive rivals that perform as well, but for style and features, the TT rivals sports cars that cost thousands more.\n\nChristmas cost: $33,200 (base 2-door convertible)\n\nChristmas message: Fun, daring, stylish and cool. Is there anymore?\n\nBMW Z3 Coupe\n\nCar and Driver called the Z3 coupe, “the face of Henry Kissinger and the moves of Josephine Baker.”\n\nOuch. That’s awfully crude for the holidays.\n\nWe think the beauty of the Z3 coupe rests in the fact its beauty is hardly skin deep.\n\nBased on the roadster of the same name, the best part of this unique two-seat coupe is not its funky frame but its low curb weight and high chassis rigidit y. It’s a fun-to-drive formula. And it’s a Z3 zoooomer.\n\nWith two new powerplants for 2001, the Z3 is available with either a 225-horse 3.0-liter in-line six or a slightly-less powerful version of the new M3’s 333-hp 3.2-liter engine. It’s heck on wheels. And it’s a looker, despite its unusual looks.\n\nInside, the Z3 is like driving a scaled-down version of some of BMW’s more popular products. It’s a tight ride without much room for movement, but with a true driver-to-road feel. Handling is razor-sharp and with BMW’s Dynamic Brake Control, ABS and an antiskid system, braking stability in turns is a lock.\n\nAnd did we mention it’s fun?\n\nChristmas cost: $38,900 (3.0i 2-door hatchback)\n\nChristmas message: Thrilling on the pedal, if not on the eyes, the Z3 might be the most fun BMW on the market.\n\nChevrolet Corvette Z06\n\nJust when you thought the American “wild child” couldn’t get any better, along comes a better Corvette.\n\nPack your seat belt hold onto your hat. What makes the new ‘Vette Z06 a real holiday gift is the fact it’s faster than some Ferraris, more slick than a few Porsches is substantially less money. Now engorged to 405 horsepower, dig into the throttle of the LS6 5.7-liter V-8 and this lightest and most athletic Corvette lunges forward at positively indecent speeds. Even in the 350-hp versions, the combination of control and raw push is enough to snap a few heads back.\n\nAnd that might not even be the best part.\n\nEven with tires fit for NASCAR, the Corvette handles and rides with the best of them. There’s also room for loads of luggage, a tasteful interior, comfortable seats, shorter gearing for better acceleration, grippier tires, a titanium exhaust and full measures of speed and excitement. This easily becomes a can’t-miss speed demon built for every enthusiast’s fancy.\n\nBig, bold and brawny, there’s no better high-performance value. A Christmas hint: Also ask for your own racetrack.\n\nX-mas cost: $48,055 (Z06 2-door coupe)\n\nX-mas message: They don’t build some race cars with this much outright passion.\n\nChrysler Prowler\n\nThe Plymouth name might be long gone, but its retro roadster roars on.\n\nWant to know the Prowler is still going strong? Listen closely as it rumbles down the street.\n\nNothing new here for the car that changed its stripes each season, but little else. It’s pretty much what it was when it first rolled out of Detroit.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s any less desirable. And a new color is major news to the Prowler faithful. This year it’s the Black Tie Edition with silver and black two-tone paint and silver floormats. We think it’s just window dressing for a classic.\n\nTurn the key and watch the heads turn. The all-aluminum 253-hp 3.5-liter V6 rumbles to life and cruises with authority, or attitude, down the street. That means 0 to 60 in about six seconds, but this is all about touring.\n\nNo luggage needed. With two cubic feet of rear room under a massive back shell – enough for a thin briefcase – this is a rear-wheel-drive hot-rod meant for a Sunday drive under blue skies.\n\nBuyers still snap them up as fast as Chrysler builds them and for good reason. With a sloped front end, manual soft top and a small, jutting nose, there’s character in this throwback.\n\nX-mas cost: $45,280\n\nX-mas message: Hot-rod retro that carries character like few others.\n\nJaguar XJR 100\n\nJaguar sedans might not be the most practical or technologically advanced set of wheels on the planet, but they’re elegant.\n\nAnd who couldn’t use more elegance in the driveway?\n\nWith tasteful styling, handsome interiors and a lightning rod under your right foot, the XJR is a lesson in deception. Don’t let the wood grain fool you – this is no technological antique. Under the hood, a supercharged and intercooled 4.0-liter DOHC 32-valve V8 makes 370 horses and makes it one of the quickest sedans we’ve dri ven (5.6 seconds in 0-to-60).\n\nAnd you’ll look good at that speed; actually, at any speed. With 18-inch wheels and Brembo brakes supporting a sleek, tasteful and distinguished interior, you can race the Mustang next to you, then race to the black-tie Christmas dinner.\n\nFor all their bulk and length outside (a whopping 202.7inches), the XJR is a little cramped inside, but it shines for its top-notch refinement, potent V8s and British charm.\n\nThe standard for any luxo-charged ride.\n\nX-mas cost: $69,355 (XJR 4-door sedan)\n\nX-mas message: Refined. Respected. And a roaring ride with an obnoxiously-smooth engine.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAll models in Jaguar’s XJ Series gain depowered front airbags and rain-sensing windshield wipers, and all-speed traction control is now standard across the board. Previously, traction control was standard only on top-rung models in the XJ range, Jaguar’s largest, most expensive sedans. Also new for 2000 is an optional satellite-based navigation system.The XJ Series was redesigned for 1995 and is expected to continue in present form until at least 2002. Among rivals are the BMW 5 Series and 7 Series sedans, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class sedans, Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45.\n\nExterior\nThe rear-drive XJ Series comes in two sizes, both with the same styling marked by a long, low profile, four round headlamps and signature Jaguar grille. The base XJ8 and XJR models ride a 113-inch wheelbase and are 198 inches long. The wheelbase and overall length are stretched 4.9 inches on the XJ8 L and Vanden Plas models.\n\nInterior\nAll models have high-grade leather, generous amounts of wood trim and a full load of comfort and convenience features. Most of the extra 4.9 inches on long-wheelbase models shows up in the rear seat, which is huge compared to the standard-size XJs. Adults have room to cross their legs, and the wider rear doors improve entry and exit.Cargo volume, however, is a skimpy 13 cubic feet on all models; the trunk has too little room to carry anything sizeable.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll versions come with Jaguar’s 4.0-liter V-8 engine and a five-speed automatic transmission. On the XJ8, XJ8 L and Vanden Plas, horsepower is 290. On the sporty XJR and Vanden Plas Supercharged models horsepower jumps to 370 from the addition of a supercharger.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",
