      "expert_review": "A voluptuous body, silky-smooth manners and a voice that purrs seductively in a refined British accent.\n\nPretty fast, too.\n\nHey, wait, we’re talking cars here.\n\nAnd the car we’re talking about is the sparkling Jaguar XK8 convertible, the lush and lovely descendant of a classic lineage of sports cars, racing cars and beautiful saloons (which is what the English call their four-door sedans).\n\nAll the attention is being focused this year on Jaguar’s new supersedan (or saloon), the frenetic XKR. But the XK8 convertible and coupe remain about the sexiest, most desirable automobiles since the early years of the XKE, in the 1960s.\n\nXK8 is very beautiful, perhaps the loveliest of all modern automobiles, and instantly recognizable as a Jaguar. Some people favor the balanced look of the coupe, which also has a semblance of a back seat, but the open-air advantage of the convertible far outweighs any such considerations.\n\nThere are quite a few hints of the fabled XKE in the styling of the XK8, particularly the sharklike grille in the rounded front end. The original version of the E-type, as the XKE is known among enthusiasts, remains a stylistic standout, and a perennial favorite among collectors. That lasting appeal could be in the future of the XK8.\n\nBut the XK8’s resemblance to the XKE is only skin deep. The E-type was a sharp-edged sports car, built for performance and bearing a significant racing heritage, while the XK8 is more of a grand-touring craft, softer and more luxurious. Unlike the cramped, simple cockpit of the XKE, the wood-and-leather interior of the XK8 is spacious (for two) and well-appointed, with a full cargo of power accessories and a superb stereo system.\n\nUnlike the E-type, which juddered and shook over rough roads with true sports-car elan, the XK8 soaks up road irregularities with grace and precision, imparting only the mildest of jars to the pampered occupants.\n\nThis is very much a fast touring car. Unlike the XKE, it doesn’t seem likely that XK8s will be showing up on many racetracks during amateur sports-car events.\n\nDespite the boulevard ride, the new Jag corners with tenacity and handles with finesse. The road holding is confidence-inducing at higher speeds, and although the heavy XK8 might not be tossable, exactly, it can be driven hard with satisfaction.\n\nA top-down trip to Globe, along curving Route 60, was incredibly nice, as much for the gorgeous scenery viewed alfresco as for the Jag’s wonderful ride and road manners.\n\nThe V-8 engine is strong and supersmooth, attached to a well-designed automatic transmission. The nearly 2-ton car is not terrifically fast on acceleration, eclipsed by the likes of Chevy Corvette, but it will get well up into the triple digits. Jaguar says it will do 155 mph, which I don’t doubt.\n\nThis is Jaguar’s first V-8, after decades of dependence on its race-bred in-line six. Although Jaguar now is owned by Ford, the Jag V-8 was realized entirely by Jaguar engi neers, without Ford content.\n\nBut Ford does have a role in the XK8, with more to do with reliability than design. Ford has a mighty big parts bin, and Jaguar’s electrical and hydraulic systems have benefited heavily from the U.S. input.\n\nThe XK8, despite its splendid design, appearance and performance, does have some clinkers, primarily in the interior. The gauges, for one thing, may be complete and well-located, but they’re too plain and ordinary-looking, doing nothing for the Jaguar’s panache.\n\nThey don’t come close to the classic look of Smith or Jaeger gauges, which would have been easy to produce with such a favorable impact. The current set would look more appropriate in a Ford Escort.\n\nOne-button operation of the convertible top, which makes it fast and easy to stow or erect, is hampered by a clumsy tonneau that is such a pain to attach that it ultimately won’t get used, leaving the folded top exposed to the elements.\n\nAs for the back “seat,” it seems ridiculous that it’s so well-upholstered. Absolutely no one can sit back there, not if they have anything resembling legs.\n\nBut in real terms, the most negative aspect of this lovely car is its towering price tag. This is also very unlike the XKE. The E-type was never cheap, but it was a reasonable aspiration for a young, middle-class person.\n\nThe XK8 is out of the realm of possibility for all but truly wealthy people, much like its leading competitors, the Mercedes SL-series cars and BMW 8-series.\n\nHead-to-head, I think the XK8 has them beat, especially in curb appeal. This car draws favorable attention everywhere it goes, loaded as it is with style, character and sex appeal.\n\n1998 Jaguar XK8\n\nVehicle type Two-passenger, two-door convertible, rear-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "Like many natural beauties, Jaguar XK8 has held up well over the years.\n\nAfter it arrived in 1996, XK8 was immediately hailed as one of the more lovely automobiles of its day and a fitting descendent of Jaguar’s most famous sports car, the XK-E.\n\nEight years later, XK8 remains a stylistic superstar and handsome status symbol. The feline mystique is still strongly evident in its curvaceous form and sinewy performance.\n\nCoupe or convertible, this is a car to enjoy driving and to be seen driving. The convertible I tested drew constant admiring glances. People watch as it glides past, eyeballing the shape from its low aggressive nose to its rounded haunches, all punctuated by a rapping, high-performance exhaust note.\n\nNice.\n\nBut some things could stand improvement. While most other designers of mid- and high-end roadsters have conceived ways for the automatic top to settle down under a hard cover, which opens and closes as the top descends, XK8 soldiers on with a lumpy-looking fabric tonneau cover that must be installed manually.\n\nThe dashboard gauges still look like something that came off a Ford assembly line. And the absurdly small rear “seat,” nicely trimmed in leather, would be more usable if it was simply a carpeted space for stowing objects. Or, that space could be used for a better system of top stowage (see above).\n\nBut on a beautiful Arizona afternoon, top down under blue skies on a rural highway, such complaints are quickly forgotten. XK8 remains one of the world’s most beautiful cars and a stellar driving experience.\n\nWhat it is\n\nA drop-dead gorgeous roadster for cruising the town or touring the countryside, with the power and performance to uphold the Jaguar reputation.\n\nPerformance\n\nAn all-aluminum, 4.2-liter V-8 puts out 290 horsepower and 303 pound-feet of torque, which is plenty of pull, even for this 2-ton roadster. In regular driving, power feels strong and immediate. But once XK8 gets up into higher speeds, the engine feels like its losing strength.\n\nThe high-performance XKR, with a supercharged, 390-horsepower V-8 and enhanced suspension and brakes, is the Ferrari-fighter of the Jaguar stable.\n\nThe standard-issue XK8 pales in comparison but still provides the goods.\n\nA six-speed automatic with a manual shifting feature is the only available transmission, underscoring XK8’s role as less of a sharp-edged sports car and more of a long-legged cruiser.\n\nDrivability\n\nThe ride is firm but forgiving, absorbing ruts and rough surfaces, providing the road-going performance of a true thoroughbred. The steering is quick and responsive, and the four-wheel disc brakes are impressive.\n\nThough XK8 achieves a good balance between cornering and comfort, the handling is soft for a sports car. XK8’s heft and comfort-tuned suspension blunts its agility through tight curves on back roads. XK8 is ha ppiest cruising at highway speed on secondary roads, as it was on a fast round trip to Payson.\n\nWith the top up, freeway driving is quiet and silky smooth, with scant noise from the wind or the road.\n\nTop down, there’s not too much wind roar or buffeting.\n\nStyling\n\nEvoking the classic charm of the XK-E, it’s hard to fault the beauty and charisma of XK8, which looks both voluptuously rounded and muscular. Everything seems nicely assembled, with no rattles, creaks or shimmies.\n\nThe folded top breaks the sleek lines, looking chunky and old-fashioned. There’s much to be said for heritage, but this part of the XK8 needs an update.\n\nThe trunk is minuscule.\n\nInterior\n\nAside from the teeny rear seat, where no human could long endure, and the generic gauge cluster, the XK8 interior upholds the traditional values of British automobiles. There’s enough thick walnut and leather to please any Anglophile.\n\nThe seats are comfortable and supportive, and there’s plenty of room for two.\n\nThe switches and controls work well enough, though the automatic climate control seemed stressed out.\n\nIt was always blowing too hot or too cold, no matter where the temperature was set.\n\nPricing\n\nOut of the range of most buyers, XK8 convertible starts at $74,330, with the coupe at $69,995. The XKR is about $12,000 more for either version.\n\nThere are a number of available options, but the test Jag came with just the basics, which in this case supplies a luxury load of convenience and power features. Shipping was $665, for a total of $74,995.\n\nBottom line\n\nStill sexy after all these years, XK8 remains a solid favorite for wealthy people who enjoy driving something special.\n\nJaguar XK8\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door convertible, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $74,330.\n\nPrice as tested: $74,665.\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter V-8, 294 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 303 pound-feet of torque at 4,100 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 101.9 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,980 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 18 city, 26 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nBeautiful styling.\n\nLush interior.\n\nHighway performance.\n\nLows:\n\nStowed top issues.\n\nGeneric gauges.\n\nAbsurd rear seat.",

      "expert_review": "A bright-red Jaguar convertible will turn the head of even the most jaded auto enthusiast, and it seemingly represents a challenge to numerous amateur racers throughout the Sacramento area.\n\nTake my word for it.\n\nDuring a week behind the wheel of a stunning, flaming-red 2003 Jaguar XK8 convertible, I was continuously invited to drag race or road race on the public streets. Challenging drivers piloted everything from massive sport-utility vehicles to sedate family sedans.\n\nMy best “go away, I’m not interested” facial expression failed to cool the competitive fires, and I had to continually resort to pulling into fast-food restaurant drive-throughs and meekly telling headset-wearing employees that I decided not to order anything.\n\nYou get the point: The ’03 Jag XK8 droptop looks hot. It’s pretty hot on the fly, too. With a 4.2-liter V-8 maxing at nearly 300 horsepower and laying down 303 foot-pounds of torque at 4,100 revolutions per minute, the XK8 left intersections with authority and pretty much ran rings around most of the hardware on the highway. An over-the-top, sport-tuned suspension gave the convertible a monorail-feel on the corners.\n\nThe stiff suspension was great for zipping around slow-moving commuters. Hitting speed bumps or even tiny road imperfections was not nearly as much fun. My teeth are still rattling from the jolts the suspension sent up my spine and into my skull.\n\nSteering was effortless, and it featured more-than-adequate feel for a light sports car. Brakes were world-class.\n\nInside, the XK8 was appropriately luxurious, and the controls were easy to understand and operate.\n\nThe two leather-lined bucket seats in the front were comfortable and could be set back to provide plenty of room for even my long legs. As for the back seat … I’m not sure it actually qualifies as a back seat. I could set my briefcase there, and my son tossed his backpack in there on runs to school. That pretty much took up all the room.\n\nA contortionist might be comfortable in the back seat allegedly designed for two, but I’m sure that most normal-size humans would be begging for mercy there after a few minutes.\n\nRiding with the soft top up, vision out the back of the car was limited. I found myself double-checking my mirrors to make sure I was not about to rub paint with another vehicle.\n\nRiding with the top down was a dream in warm weather. Wind buffeting was virtually zip, and I had a good field of vision for 360 degrees. Happily, the convertible top powered up and down with ease — a vast improvement over my experience with the previous-year XK8. The top on my 2002 tester froze in place, and no amount of tinkering would budge it.\n\nThere was one annoyance that seems trivial now, but it was a major embarrassment for about 20 seconds. The Jaguar had one of those hand brakes — mounted on the driver’s left hip in the XK8 — that is engaged by pulling up, but once engaged, the hand brake does not remain at an elevated angle but drops back to the floor.\n\nThe trick is that to release the hand brake, you have to pull it up until you get sufficient pressure, then press down on a button mounted on top. Should you fail to do that correctly, putting the car in drive and stepping on the gas will get you a lurch forward and propel the tip of your nose within an inch of the steering wheel.\n\nThis happened to me the first time I backed the XK8 out of my driveway, and if the neighbors were watching, no, I was not attempting to depress the accelerator with my right knee and drive the car with my nose. After this episode, I always checked the message center behind the steering wheel to make sure the red “brake” light was off before hitting the gas.\n\nMy feeling about the XK8 — and all Jaguar convertibles, for that matter — is that it is the prototypical niche car. Fortunate XK8 convertible buyers can plop down ut $80,000 to get a high-performance machine that’s great for, say, making a warm-weather run down to Big Sur or twisting up Highway 50 to Lake Tahoe. It’s fun for a driver and one passenger who appreciate sports car motoring and the admiring glances they get when whipping past more-pedestrian transportation.\n\nThe 2003 XK8 convertible was not built for runs to the day-care center or those shopping bag-laden returns from the supermarket. The car’s purpose is to deliver performance and sporty enjoyment.\n\nOn that score, the XK8 hits a home run.\n\n2003 Jaguar XK8 at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2003 Jaguar XK8.\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, rear-drive, high-performance luxury convertible.\n\nBase price: $74,975.\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter V-8 with 294 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 303 foot-pounds of torque at 4,100 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 17 miles per gallon city; 24 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic with clutchless manual shifting option.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel vented discs with anti-lock and special enhancement features.\n\nSuspension type: Sport-tuned, fully independent front and rear (with wishbones, coil springs and anti-roll bars front and rear).\n\nInterior volume: 70 cubic feet (estimated).\n\nTrunk volume: 10.8 cubic feet.\n\nFuel tank: 19.9 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 3,980 pounds.\n\nFront track: 59.2 inches.\n\nRear track: 59 inches.\n\nHeight: 51 inches.\n\nLength: 187.4 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 101.9 inches.\n\nWidth: 81.7 inches.\n\nTires: P245/45ZR18 performance tires on front; P255/45ZR18s on rear.\n\nAssembly point: Coventry, England.",

      "expert_review": "While down South recently, I talked to the owner of a racing team whosepersonal garage included a Jaguar XJ6, a 1970 Jaguar XKE, a new Jaguar XK8 anda Mini Cooper.\n\nI asked him which Jag was his fave, considering the nice selection at hisdisposal.\n\n`’The XKE, no question,” came the reply.\n\nWhy?\n\n“The XKE is a brutal sports car. The XK8 is more of a grand tourer.”\n\nAfter a week in the beautiful new XK8, I can surely agree.\n\nCertainly, nothing is quite the same as the stunning XKE, even though theall-new-for-’97 XK8 certainly plays on the E’s styling heritage. But then, theBritish Empire isn’t the same as it was in the ’60s.\n\nWhen the E-type first appeared, it did battle with any number of Anglonameplates, in addition to American and European competition. Now Jaguarstands as a lonely remainder of a much grander past, like Britannia herself.Unlike its motherland, this car and car company are serious competition andvery much a world player.\n\nThe wide-mouthed opening on the XK8’s front with its solitary chrome barrecalls its proud bloodline. Ditto the styling of the bonnet (that’s Britishfor hood). If the rest of the car is more original, it’s also more modern,with a touch of influence from Jaguar’s latest competitors, the Japanese.\n\nWhat’s under the bonnet is as striking as the car’s stunning styling. It’san all-new aluminum-block, 32-valve, double-overhead-cam V8, Jaguar’s first V8and only their fourth all-new engine. It’s 4.0-liter displacement (244 cubicinches to us Yanks) pours out a healthy 290 horsepower and 284 foot-pounds oftorque. It’s mated to an equally new ZF five-speed automatic transmission thatclicks off the shifts quickly and smoothly.\n\nSo, faster than you can say tally-ho, this cat is sprinting down the roadat extra-legal speeds. Since this is only a third of the way through the170-mph speedometer, you might find it too easy to go fast.\n\nThere are normal and sport shift modes. Normal is almostfor statelycruising, for times when a quick burst of speed isn’t always a top priority.But shift it into sport, and the car feels much more alive, taking to the roadlike paparazzi to Princess Di.\n\nAiding this cat’s appetite for speed is a superb suspension with a delicatebalance that Jags always seem to have. It’s sporty enough to make the carflingable, yet supple enough to tame the worst road surfaces. If you enjoyinsulation, you won’t enjoy this Jag, but if you love agility with a dose ofrefinement, its fully independent suspension delivers.\n\nThe car claws through corners with an attitude that’s flat and a tailthat’s controllable. Turn off the optional traction control and you can havesome real fun. But do so at your wallet’s risk. The car is equipped with meaty17-inch Z-rated Pirellis (for sustained speeds in excess of 149 mph).\n\nBrakes are four-wheel discs with anti-lock, ensuring short, straight stopsabsent of nose dive. The steering is a speed-sensitive, variab le ratio setup,with decent heft and some road feel. It made walking this feline easy.\n\nThe inside is equal in its way to the outside. The dash recalls cars ofdays long gone, with a broad horizontal expanse of beautifully finished woodinto which the round gauges are set. Tachometer, speedometer, gas andtemperature monitors are in three round openings in front of the driver. Tothe right are a clock and two more gauges. Set below are the controls for thedual climate control, heated seats and audio system.\n\nThe transmission tunnel robs the front seats of some space, especially footroom around the accelerator, but it’s no worse than most coupes. The parkingbrake is to the left of the driver. One odd omission: The windows are notauto-down, a feature found on the most mundane of cars. Otherwise, all thecreature comforts one expects in this league are present.\n\nThe front seats are as comfy as the Queen’s throne, with one-piece seatbacks, an usual style. The rear seats arebe t used for stashing extra VHStapes of British sitcoms, since anything bigger than that won’t fit.\n\nThe 11.6-cubic-foot boot (that’s trunk in the Queen’s English) will hold acouple of bags of golf clubs, maybe even a couple weekend bags. The trunkhinges don’t interfere with cargo, but who cares about such practical concernswhen it’s a Jag?\n\nOne bugaboo that always comes up about Jags from Jag wags is reliability.Nothing actually went wrong, although I’m not sure if the trip computeractually works — I never got it to. But it never failed to start and neverrattled. Ford, which has owned Jaguar for four years, has done a good job ofimproving quality — this is the best-built Jaguar I have ever driven.\n\nUltimately, what one remembers most is the fine styling with its beautifulwood and leather accents, and the fine drive train with its menacing growlemanating from dual chrome-tipped exhausts, all adding up to an unforgettabledriving experience that is unique to this sexy feline.\n\nI certainly found the opposite sex very interested in this car. I asked myfriend if his Jags attracted that kind of attention from the fairer sex.\n\n“Actually, they like the Mini the best,” he said.\n\nGo figure.\n\nJAGUAR XK8 COUPEBase price: $64,900Options: Convenience Package, All Weather Package, CD ChangerAs tested: $68,630EPA rating: 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highwayTest mileage: 20 mpg",

      "expert_review": "It was a verdant day. Even the air was green. Pollen. It powdered the atmosphere. It covered everything. I lowered the top on the Jaguar XK8 convertible anyway.\n\nCoughing and sneezing followed. There was misery, but it was worth the pain. It’s hard to say no to a topless Jaguar.\n\nBesides, I’d already shown restraint. I left the carnival-red XK8 in my driveway for two days in favor spending time with a more practical car, the Volvo S40 sedan. But once the S40 was gone, I could resist no longer. Even under a thickening film of pollen, the XK8 looked sexy.\n\nSo I dusted its body with a soft cloth. I keyed its ignition, pressed a black button on its center console and lowered its power convertible roof.\n\nThere was joy in taking down the roof. There was ballet — the way a small electric motor opened a latch, freeing the roof from the windshield’s frame; the way the roof lifted back, folded at mid-rise and sank gracefully into its storage area behind the rear seats; the way the car’s four side windows lowered themselves in concert with all of this.\n\nI sat for a moment listening to the thrummm, thrummm of the XK8’s 290-horsepower V-8 engine. Thrummm, thrummm. A Jaguar is a cat that doesn’t purr.\n\nIt was a wasteful thing to do, sitting there in idle in the midst of rising gas prices listening to an engine burn premium unleaded fuel. But profligacy in celebration of beauty has its virtue. Listening to that engine turn over was like listening to jazz. The venue was different — a fume-filled driveway vs. a smoke-filled room.\n\nI backed out of the driveway into the street. This was done carefully. We were a heavy package, the XK8 and I. Our combined weights exceeded 4,000 pounds, and the XK8’s bottom cleared the ground by 5 1/2 inches, barely enough to avoid banging its undercarriage at the end of the steeply banked driveway.\n\nBut the car’s four-wheel independent suspension system, with front and rear stabilizer bars, handled the load admirably. I didn’t scrape bottom. I steered the XK8 toward westbound Interstate 66 and headed for glory.\n\nThe thrummm of the car’s engine became a hummm, and there was epiphany in the transition. The XK8 had a price tag of $74,000; when people would ask the price and I would tell them, they’d look stunned and ask me “Why?”\n\nWell, here was the answer in motion and sculpted beauty, arguably the most beautifully sculpted car on the road anywhere. You don’t just drive an XK8. You do more than go for a ride. You become part of a performance, a kinetic piece of art — part dance, part jazz, part sculpture.\n\nYou pay for the joy and beauty of it, in much the same way that you’d pay for a Picasso or for season tickets to the Birmingham Royal Ballet.\n\nOtherwise, it would make no sense, because there is nothing practically sensible about owning an XK8.\n\nIts rear seats are useless. Its cargo capa city of 10.8 cubic feet is a joke. Diogenes might have gone about ancient Greece vainly searching for an honest man, but had he parked an XK8 overnight on a city street, he would’ve had no trouble finding a thief. High-end garaging is needed. I paid some pretty stiff parking fees for this one.\n\nBut I thought about none of those shortcomings while driving. The car moved so gracefully through space and time, it turned traffic jams into theater.\n\nIn the end, I didn’t mind inhaling the pollen during several hours of open-air motoring. I didn’t mind paying parking ransoms in the city. It was worth the pain — for a little while, anyway.",
