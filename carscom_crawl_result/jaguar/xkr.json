      "expert_review": "Please fasten your seat belts, put trays in the upright position and stow any carry-on luggage under the seat before pressing the accelerator on the 2000 Jaguar XKR, because the instant you do, you are going to experience launch.\n\nNo need to sit back. The XKR will do that for you by implanting your backside a couple inches deep into the cowhide as you hold the wheel with both hands and watch the scenery streak past.\n\nFor a brief moment you don’t care if gas is $1.60 a gallon or $1.60 a pint and whether the air slapping the top of your melon has been sufficiently treated to keep the government happy.\n\nFollowing on the success of its new small S-Type luxury sedan (Cartalk, May 23, 1999) that bowed last summer, Jaguar brought out the XKR coupe and convertible last fall, a high-performance model based on the XK8 sports coupe that’s powered by a supercharged 370-horsepower version of the 4-liter V-8 offered in the XJR sedan and teamed with a 5-speed automatic. The XKR is in response to those wanting even more performance as well as excitement than the XK8.\n\nThe XKR boasts a zero- to 60-m.p.h. time of 5.2 seconds (5.3 with convertible), fastest Jaguar in the stable.\n\nStylewise, the XKR features a wire-mesh grille, functional hood louvers, decklid spoiler and 18-inch alloy wheels with Z-rated Pirelli performance tires–8 inches wide up front, 9 inches wide in the rear, developed for optimum steering response and high-speed stability.\n\nWe tested the 2000 XKR convertible, the open-top member of the XKR coupe and convertible duo of limited production high-performance Jaguars, the vehicle for those who want more kick than the XK8 coupe or convertible with its normally aspirated 4-liter, 290-h.p. V-8 can deliver.\n\nThe XKR comes with Computer Active Technology Suspension (CATS, the same as on the S-Type) that provides computer controlled suspension adjustments to maximize ride and handling, a most appreciated feature in between as well as during those power takeoffs. CATS is teamed with Servtronic II steering for sure-footed cornering, along with the typical Jaguar burl walnut and leather interior treatment.\n\nOf course, once you’ve spent time playing rocket launcher, there are a few drawbacks with the car. For one, even with the CATS system, the suspension exhibited a slight case of the jitters on a stretch of lumpy, bumpy, pothole-pocked road. Of course, you might say, how would the XKR have performed on that lumpy, bumpy, pothole-pocked road without CATS? Have to admit the answer probably would have been not as well as it did.\n\nOn the much smoother interstate, CATS performed very well. If you hand over $81,800 for a XKR convertible ($76,800 for coupe), chances are you are going to spend more time on smooth surfaces than you will tracking down potholes, lumps or bumps.\n\nAlso, while those power launches were fun, each time we were slapped back into the bucket, the front end seem to rise for takeoff. What you want in a high-power bullet is for the front end to sit still–and level.\n\nAbout the only other drawbacks with this toy were the fact that when getting out we noticed that the back of the driver’s seat was against the cushion on the rear seat, meaning that anyone attempting travel in back woul d have to sit Indian style with legs folded on the seat, if political correctness allows such a description.\n\nAnd, if you enjoy golf, be advised that the convertible hardware devours so much trunk room that you’ll have to carry your clubs in the back seat, and even they’ll have a tight fit.\n\nOther standard equipment includes traction control with brake and engine regulation, a steering column that motors out of the way to allow for easier exit, a power top with heated glass window that can be closed even if you are traveling at speeds up to 10 m.p.h., heated seats, premium audio system with six-disc CD changer, power headlamp washers and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nAll but the power headlamp washers are appreciated. The Lord gave us paper towels to wipe the lenses rather than using power headlamp washers. Besides, if you do enough power launches in the XKR, you will find yourself with the cleanest lenses in the county.\n\nThe only option on the XKR is a $2,400 navigation system, another item not really needed unless a sense of direction is beyond your realm, in which case you should be taking public transportation. The best navigation system in the world was designed years ago by Rand McNally, though in fairness, you don’t have to fold the Jaguar unit.\n\nOne other XKR drawback–try to find one. Only about 5,000 will be sold in the U.S. for 2000 and all are accounted for. Jaguar says it will increase availability for 2001 but without exceeding demand. With high demand and low supply, be prepared to pay a ransom if you find one.\n\nJaguar insiders say one Wall Street banker type has been unable to acquire one though he has $5,000 deposits at five dealerships along the East Coast. Feel sorry for the poor soul, don’t you?\n\nStill to come from Jaguar is an even smaller luxury sedan about the size of a BMW 3-Series or Mercedes-Benz C-Class. It will arrive in calendar 2000 as a 2001 model. The car is now known as the X400 and will be the entry-level as well as high-volume sedan in the Jaguar lineup. It will not be shared with Lincoln, which has shelved plans to offer a version.\n\nThe X400 will be priced around $30,000, and Jaguar hopes to sell 40,000 to 50,000 annually in the U.S.\n\nAlso in the works is a high-performance two-seater. Last year Jaguar unveiled the XK180 concept roadster built off the XK8 coupe. It was powered by a 450-h.p. version of the supercharged 4-liter V-8. While two were built for show, none will see production, Jaguar says.\n\nInstead, Jaguar has come up with the F-Type roadster design concept that is 25 inches shorter than the XK8. Jaguar has a team working on its development, and a decision to move ahead with production is expected in six to nine months. The two-seater could be produced within 30 months of approval and be on the streets within three years.\n\nThe F-Type still has to get the approval of Ford management as well as its boa rd. Chances of Ford President Jac Nasser giving the F-Type a thumbs down are slim and none.\n\n“There’s not a person in the company who doesn’t want to build the F-Type,” said Simone Sproule, director of public relations for Jaguar. “There’s no shortage of passion within the company for it, and no shortage of buyer deposits that have been placed at dealerships in order to get one of the first ones.”\n\nThe F-Type has no engine as yet. In fact, which engine, which platform and where to build it are the three hurdles to production. What is known, however, is that the F-Type would be the smallest car in the Jaguar lineup since the E-Type two-seater last sold in 1974, and that it would compete with the Porsche Boxster more so than the Mercedes SLK roadster, insiders say. Price: about $50,000. Production numbers: very low.\n\nThe X400 and F-Type, as well as the XK coupe, XJ and S-Type sedans, were made possible by Ford Motor Co.’s decision 10 years ago to acquire the automaker and provide Jaguar with not only the investment funds, but also the engineering and technology to bring out viable machines.\n\nIn calendar 1999, Jaguar sold 35,000 cars in the U.S., a 140 percent increase over 1998. Hard to believe, but 1999 was the first year the automaker advertised on network TV. Some will credit the ads for the sales increase; however, most will say a greater focus on quality and the introduction of the stylish S-Type that shares the platform with the Lincoln LS made a greater contribution.\n\nThe forecast for 2000 is sales of more than 40,000 units in the U.S. The goal, though no timetable has been set, is to sell 100,000 vehicles annually here once the lineup expands to five models: the XJ, S-Type and X400 sedans and XK and F-Type sports cars.\n\n>> 2000 Jaguar XKR convertible Wheelbase: 101.9 inches Length: 187.4 inches Engine: 4-liter, 370-h.p., 32-valve supercharged V-8 Transmission: 5-speed automatic Fuel economy: 16 m.p.g. city/22 m.p.g. highway Base price: $81,800 Price as tested: $84,200. Includes $2,400 for navigation system. Add $595 for freight. Pluses: Solid top-down cruiser. Kick the pedal and hold onto the wheel because the supercharged V-8 will very quickly imbed your body into the cowhide wrapped seat. Power top can be closed even if you are traveling at speeds up to 10 m.p.h. Minuses: Front seat back touches rear-seat cushion, meaning rear-seat occupants must kneel on seat to fit. XKR will pass anything on road except a gas station. Golf clubs have to rest in back seat or you have to take up croquet because they ain’t gonna fit in the trunk. Try to find an XKR, and if you do, better have the ransom money handy. >>",

      "expert_review": "No one likes to hear this kind of thing from the likes of a car reviewer, but we actually don’t get overly excited when a new car comes in. We approach it with the sober eye of a judge. (That, and we know it will be replaced in a day or so, possibly by something lame.) But I’ll tell you, a model that gets our editors pretty excited, every time, is the Jaguar XK. Its looks and driving experience come together in a way that’s seldom matched.\n\nPerhaps it was the uncertainty of being for sale, and then sold to India’s Tata Motors, that has kept the model virtually unchanged for a few years. All the same, Jaguar added a couple new tricks for the 2009 model year on both the XK and the XKR, the high-performance version that’s available in both coupe and convertible body styles. (Compare the two years side by side.) Most notably, you can now get a Bowers & Wilkins premium stereo with eight speakers rather than six, a heartier amplifier and two digital inputs: one a USB port and the other an iPod jack for playing and controlling MP3 players through the stereo. I tested an XKR that had the stereo option. Significant drivetrain, suspension and interior changes make the R even more exciting to drive. Unfortunately, some of the same quality concerns that plague the XK are harder to accept in this premium-priced variant.\n\n \n\nPower to Spare\nA supercharged version of the Jaguar XK’s 4.2-liter V-8 shaves 1 second off the XKR’s 0-60 mph times: The coupe does it in 4.9 seconds and the convertible is close behind at 5.0 seconds, according to Jaguar. Unlike a turbo, the supercharger provides its boost at lower engine speeds, so the character of the regular XK’s drivetrain is preserved; it has loads of gusto right off the line. Thanks to its six speeds, the automatic transmission assures good passing power at highway speeds, too. The early EPA gas-mileage estimates were overly optimistic, with the same numbers given for the XK and XKR. The XKR is thirstier by 1 to 2 mpg. It still skates by without a gas-guzzler tax, though.\n\nXK Series Engines\nModel\tXK\tXKR\nEngine\t4.2-liter V8\tSupercharged 4.2-liter V8\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t300\n@ 6,000\t420\n@ 6,000\nTorque\n(lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t310\n@ 4,100\t413\n@ 4,000\nEPA-estimated gas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t16/25\t15/23\nRecommended gasoline\tPremium\n(91 octane)\tPremium\n(91 octane)\nSource: Manufacturer\n\n \n\nThe Jaguar XK’s six-speed automatic, one of the best transmissions I’ve driven, performed just as well here in the R, always seeming to do what I wanted it to do — especially in Sport mode — without my having to resort to the shift paddles. It also exacts its shifts — up and down — exceptionally quickly.\n\n \n\nSound Without Noise\nNoise is very well-managed in the Jaguar XK series, especially in the convertible I tested last year, where noise is expected and usually accepted. Credit the thick, insulated soft-top. The most noticeable sound in my Jaguar XKR convertible was the exhaust rumble, which, like that of the regular XK, is among the best-sounding on the market. To keep a low profile, the Active Exhaust System mutes the exhaust during normal driving, but it opens a louver in the muffler during heavy acceleration, unleashing the growl. Jaguar opted to keep the supercharger’s characteristic moan to a minimum. I was a little disappointed, because I like the way these chargers sound, but I suppose it makes sense for a luxury car. The coupe sounded a little quieter, but only a little. They’ve come a long way with soft convertible tops.\n\nAthletic & Balanced\nI was impressed by the XK’s athleticism and balance, and the R dials it up a notch with firmer springs and shock absorbers. Though the ride quality is more taut, I found it livable in normal driving. Anyone concerned about the ride might want to stick with the standard 19-inch wheels. The optional 20-inchers on my test car come with lower-series tires that are even less compliant.\n\nJaguar recalibrated the adaptive suspension to work with the new spring and shock rates, and it still does a good job of controlling body roll. Like the Jaguar XK, the R has a very grounded feel and balanced handling. The new arrangement probably makes for better roadholding on the smoothest roads, but when cornering on bumpy pavement I experienced a little lateral hopping that I don’t remember from the regular XK. The XKR has less power-steering assist than the XK, and thus more feedback.\n\nBetter From a Distance\nThe first thing you notice on the Jaguar XKR is its silvery grille, which happens to be the worst mistake Jaguar could have made — especially on this beautiful, high-profile model. Historically, R variants have had stainless-steel woven-wire mesh grilles in place of the regular model’s conventional black mesh. Now it’s clearly a plastic matrix with what Jaguar calls an aluminum finish. Perhaps it’s the different color, but our 2009’s didn’t look as bad as the earlier, sky blue test car, but it still looks like plastic — cheap, low-class, inexcusable plastic. I also found fault with the interior, in which the optional semi-gloss wood trim looked good, but some of the trim pieces — like the shifter bezel and steering wheel spokes — just don’t have the finish quality one expects at this price.\n\n\nThere were functional quirks, too, and I don’t always mention little glitches in reviews because oftentimes our test cars are pre-production models, but this is a car that’s been out awhile, and it’s not the first time I’ve had electronics glitches. Jaguars used to be known for electrical problems, but that was before computers proliferated, and that’s where the problem seems to lie now. In a previous XK test car I had a turn signal stay on no matter what I did. (I must have really stood out, because I didn’t happen to be driving in Florida.) After puzzling over it for some time, I turned off and restarted the engine a couple times, which is like rebooting a computer. When it didn’t help after the first time, I was concerned. The second one did it. With this Jaguar XKR, I pulled into a space in our parking structure, turned the car off and then realized I was parked crooked. I started again, backed out and the engine died. It kept cranking, starting and dying. Cranking, starting and dying — and I was blocking the way. I was planning to call Jaguar when it occurred to me that the keyless ignition might interpret “off” differently than I do. I opened the door, got out, closed and locked it. When I got back in, the engine started right up. Three cheers for educated guessing.\n\n\nRemember, we’re talking about a car base-priced at over $82,000. Jaguar has an image problem — partly deserved and partly not. Then there’s the fact that Ford Motor Co. owned the brand for almost 20 years. I personally don’t care who owns what; the proof is in the product. But many buyers do care. A surprising number know that Ford owns Jaguar, and many consider this a bad thing — perhaps because they’ve had a problem with a Ford in the past, or perhaps just because Ford is a modest American brand that is perceived to sully the historic British luxury line and in some way diminish its international intrigue. One would think Ford would have been aware of this bias and go out of its way to prevent anything that could put its products’ quality in question. That the automotive industry as a whole continues to shave cents (yes, in some cases just cents) off each car it builds and then throw, in some cases, thousands of dollars worth of incentives on the hood remains one of the most asinine practices in any industry anywhere. Will Ford and its current travails taint the models designed under its ownership? Has that intrigue returned to the U.S. now that Jaguar is owned by another foreign company?\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "“That yours?” asked the man standing outside the 7-Eleven.\n\n“Nope,” I said.\n\n“Didn’t think so,” he said.\n\nOuch! After all, I had driven up in this 2007 Jaguar XKR convertible, and he couldn’t have seen the manufacturer’s license plate on the back, nor could he be aware that I was about to purchase a Diet Dr Pepper with pennies and nickels.\n\nBut clearly, there is something so non-Jaguar XKR about me that he was confident I was, I suppose, a thief, a repo man, off-duty Jaguar salesman or, heaven forfend, a poor but honest automotive journalist. Sadly, I had driven up to this very 7-Eleven barely a week earlier in a Kia Rio, and nobody thought it wasn’t mine.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have told him I owned the Jaguar, and flashed the $50 bill my wife lets me keep folded up in my wallet for emergencies, but who would I be kidding? Just some elderly psychic standing outside a store with nothing better to do than break a man’s heart.\n\nAnyway, about this Jaguar: The XK debuted as a 1997 model and was the first genuine sign since Ford bought the company in 1989 that they intended to at least try and return some magic to the marque. The graceful shape and taut chassis could not be denied, though the 290-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-8 seemed a little tame.\n\nThat XK kept the Jaguar flame burning until the 2007 model year, when this long-awaited redesign debuted, and while it wasn’t the groundbreaker from a decade before, it advanced the XK in every way.\n\nThe regular XK coupe and convertible are powered by a 4.2-liter, 300-horsepower V-8, while the sportier XKR has a supercharged version of the 4.2-liter V-8 that pumps out a means-business 420 horsepower. Jaguar still doesn’t offer a manual transmission, but the six-speed automatic works very well.\n\nThe 1997 XK was more fun to be seen in than to drive: Not so the 2007 model, especially the XKR. Yes, the rear seats are useless and trunk space, especially with the convertible, is marginal, but no one buys an XKR for carpooling. A Chevrolet Corvette convertible, for about $39,000 less, goes just as fast and handles better, but there’s an elegance to this XKR that no Corvette has yet approached.\n\nWe still hear the occasional grim story about Jaguar workmanship, but the test XKR showed no evidence of pending problems. The leather interior and woodgrain trim was applied and executed to perfection, and mechanically, everything worked as it should. As it certainly should for $96,010 — that included a “premium sound package” ($1,875) and a “luxury package” ($2,100) that upgraded some interior trim.\n\nI may not look like an XKR owner, but to those who are: Good choice.",

      "expert_review": "For those with upwards of $50,000 to invest in a midlife crisis, there are sports cars, and there are “sporty” cars, and it can be difficult to tell the difference. There’s little argument that the Chevrolet Corvette, Porsche 911 and Acura NSX are sports cars.\n\nBut what about the Cadillac XLR, Lexus SC430 and the Jaguar XK convertible? All have powerful engines, either no rear seat or a tiny one, and the tops go down. But I’d submit that those three are “sporty” cars.\n\nThe Corvette, Porsche and Acura stress performance, luxury and comfort – in that order. The Cadillac, Lexus and Jaguar stress luxury, comfort and performance – in that order.\n\nBut the test vehicle, the Jaguar XKR, further blurs the line. The regular XK convertible has a 4.2-liter, 294-horsepower V-8. The XKR has that same V-8 but adds a supercharger – essentially a belt-driven fan that forces fuel and air into the engine under pressure – that ups horsepower to a potent 390.\n\nBut that power is delivered so seamlessly that aside from the whine from the supercharger, there’s no auditory tipoff that the XKR is accelerating very quickly. Road and wind noise is minimal. Check the speedometer, and you realize that yes, we’re about to make a traffic officer very interested.\n\nThe XKR, then, is a sports car, masquerading as a sporty car. Handling is crisp but never at the expense of a smooth ride. The interior trim is impeccable. Instruments and controls could be better configured, but you figure them out quickly.\n\nThere are some not-so-sporting aspects. True sports cars are available with a manual transmission, but the XKR isn’t. The six-speed automatic is very capable, though, but why Jaguar holds onto the annoying “J gate” shifter is a mystery. “Park” is at the top of the J; to go, you pull the console-mounted lever back toward you, then to your left, then back up toward the other end of the J. It’s awkward, takes up a lot of room, and serves no purpose other than to salute tradition. Likely that’s why it survives – when Ford took over Jaguar in 1990, loyalists bleated about the purity of the British marque being diluted; perhaps Ford wants to be able to say, ‘Look! We kept your stupid shifter!”\n\nActually, Ford’s influence has been mostly positive. Jaguar workmanship had become rather grim, but it has improved dramatically in the last decade. Even with Ford’s engineering and financial help, the XK has grown a bit long in the tooth, looking – and feeling – a lot like the car I drove in 1996, when the XK debuted as a ’97 model. It’s due for an update, and one is coming soon, now that the XJ sedan has been brought into the 21st century.\n\nThe XKR costs $87,995, including a $1,000 federal gas-guzzler tax. There are options, such as several choices of 20-inch wheels for $6,000 a set, but that’s just excess. As it is, the Jaguar XKR is powerful medicine for a midlife crisis.\n\nBase price: $86,330.\n\nPric e as tested: $87,995.\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive convertible with a 4.2-liter, 390-horsepower supercharged V-8, with a 6six-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2006 about the convertible version of the 2007 Jaguar XKR. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2007 Jaguar XKR is a high-performance version of the XK, available in both coupe and convertible body styles. Significant drivetrain, suspension and interior changes make the R even more exciting to drive. Unfortunately, some of the same quality concerns that plague the XK — and a couple of new ones — are harder to accept in this premium-priced variant.\n\nI raved about the 2007 Jaguar XK coupe and convertible in a separate review, so I’ll focus here on what distinguishes the XKR from the regular XK … and cools my enthusiasm.\n\nPower to Spare\nA supercharged version of the XK’s 4.2-liter V-8 shaves 1 second off the XKR’s 0 – 60 mph times: The coupe does it in 4.9 seconds and the convertible is close behind at 5.0 seconds, according to Jaguar. Unlike a turbo, the supercharger provides its boost at lower engine speeds, so the character of the regular XK’s drivetrain is preserved; it has loads of gusto right off the line. This version is simply stronger. Thanks to its six speeds, the automatic transmission assures good passing power at highway speeds, too. The EPA gas-mileage estimates are, shockingly, the same as the XK model’s. (It surprised Jaguar, too.) Early fuel-economy estimates can be unreliable, but even if they’re adjusted downward, this is bound to be a very efficient car compared to its competitors, many of which are subject to a gas-guzzler tax. The XKR is not.\n\nXK Series Engines\nModel\tXK\tXKR\nEngine\t4.2-liter V-8\tSupercharged 4.2-liter V-8\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t300\n@ 6,000\t420\n@ 6,000\nTorque\n(lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t310\n@ 4,100\t413\n@ 4,000\nEPA-estimated gas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t18/27\t18/27\nRecommended gasoline\tPremium\n(91 octane)\tPremium\n(91 octane)\nSource: Manufacturer\n\nThe XK’s six-speed automatic, one of the best transmissions I’ve driven, performed just as well here in the R, always seeming to do what I wanted it to do — especially in Sport mode — without my having to resort to the shift paddles. It also exacts its shifts — up and down — exceptionally quickly.\n\nSound Without Noise\nNoise is very well-managed in the XK series, especially in the convertible, where noise is expected and usually accepted. Credit the thick, insulated soft-top. The most noticeable sound in my XKR convertible was the exhaust rumble, which, like that of the regular XK, is among the best-sounding on the market. To keep a low profile, the Active Exhaust System mutes the exhaust during normal driving, but it opens a louver in the muffler during heavy acceleration, unleashing the growl. Jaguar opted to keep the supercharger’s characteristic moan to a minimum. I was a little disappointed, because I like the way these chargers sound, but I suppose it makes sense for a luxury car.\n\nAthletic & Balanced\nI was impressed by the XK’s athleticism and balance, and the R dials it up a notch with firmer springs and shock absorbers. Though the ride quality is more taut, I found it liveable in normal driving. Anyone concerned about the ride might want to stick with the standard 19-inch wheels. The optional 20-inchers on my test car come with lower-series tires that are even less compliant.\n\nJaguar recalibrated the adaptive suspension to work with the new spring and shock rates, and it still does a good job of controlling body roll. Like the XK, the R has a very grounded feel and balanced handling. The new arrangement probably makes for better roadholding on the smoothest roads, but when cornering on bumpy pavement I experienced a little lateral hopping that I don’t remember from the regular XK. If you have any experience with the cars, drop me an email. The XKR has less power-steering assist than the XK, and thus more feedback.\n\nBetter From a Distance\nThe first thing you notice on the XKR is its silvery grille, which happens to be the worst mistake Jaguar could have made — especially on this beautiful, high-profile model. Historically, R variants have had stainless-steel woven-wire mesh grilles in place of the regular model’s conventional black mesh. On the 2007 it’s clearly a plastic matrix with what Jaguar calls an aluminum finish. It looks like plastic — cheap, low-class, inexcusable plastic. I was also crestfallen to find the same detached trunk liner in this car that I reported on in the XK review. It’s obviously a chronic problem. I also found fault with the interior, in which the optional semi-gloss wood trim looked good, but some of the trim pieces — like the shifter bezel and steering wheel spokes — just don’t have the finish quality one expects at this price.\n\nRemember, we’re talking about a $92,000 car here — $102,000 as equipped, in the case of my test car. For that price you can get a BMW M6, a Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG or an Audi S6 that’s loaded to the gills, with cash left over. Though they’re not perfect, these models’ shortcomings aren’t as glaring. Jaguar has an image problem — partly deserved and partly not. A decade or so of nightmarish reliability and dodgy electrical systems haunts the brand to this day, years after they’ve been improved. Then there’s the fact that Ford Motor Co. has owned the brand for about 17 years. I personally don’t care who owns what; the proof is in the product. But many buyers do care. A surprising number know that Ford owns Jaguar, and many consider this a bad thing — perhaps because they’ve had a problem with a Ford in the past, or perhaps just because Ford is a modest American brand that is perceived to sully the historic British luxury line and in some way diminish its international intrigue.\n\nHow much could a real wire-mesh grille cost, and how could that not be appropriate for a car that costs this much? Yes, the XKR’s entire body is constructed of expensive aluminum, the many computerized systems onboard are sophisticated and costly, and the car’s underlying quality could actually be quite good. But does it matter, if shoppers don’t get close enough to experience any of this? The look of a grille is more than enough to turn away a would-be buyer — especially one who has negative preconceived notions.\n\nOne would think Ford would be aware of this bias and go out of its way to prevent anything that could put its products’ quality in question. That the automotive industry as a whole continues to shave cents (yes, in some cases just cents) off each car it builds and then throw, in some cases, thousands of dollars worth of incentives on the hood remains one of the most asinine practices in any industry anywhere.\n\nThe XKR is such a good-looking, great-driving car. It deserves better, and buyers demand it.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "There have been hundreds of changes made to the Jaguar XK series since it debuted in 1996, but not that many to the exterior. Perhaps that’s a good thing if you believe the XK’s design is classic and should not be tampered with.\n\nOr perhaps it’s a bad thing if you spent upward of $93,000 on a 2003 XKR, but realize it looks an awful lot like a 1997 XK8 convertible, currently retailing for about $29,500.\n\nOr maybe it just doesn’t matter. In a week people will be able to see the latest James Bond film, Die Another Day, and you XKR owners can mention that the villainous Zao is driving an XKR just like yours, though presumably yours does not have missiles (behind the grille), machine gun (between the seats), rocket launchers (in the door), and mortars (in the trunk). Of course, Bond’s Aston Martin Vanquish has its share of not-from-the-factory options, too. The fact that the filmmakers required Jaguar to supply eight XKRs suggests that mayhem ensues.\n\nOur test of the 2003 XKR convertible was thankfully mayhem-free, but the car is not exactly anonymous. With 390 horsepower on tap from the supercharged 4.2-liter V-8, a gentle right foot is required to maintain a low profile.\n\nThe XKR is a higher-performance version of the XK8, which has 294 horsepower. The 2003 XKR gets a 30-horsepower boost over last year, thanks mostly to an increase in the engine’s size from 4.0 to 4.2 liters. There’s also an eager new six-speed automatic transmission which that works hard to maximize the engine’s power.\n\nInside, it’s all leather and wood and wonderful Recaro bucket seats. Rear seats exist in theory only: No one over two feet tall could possibly fit.\n\nOn the road, the XKR is very fast. but The power does not come in a kick-in-the-pants sort of way, but a bit more gradually. The engine is very quiet, and the only sound you hear is the supercharger’s whine, augmented by your passenger’s whine as you near maximum velocity.\n\nThe test car had the optional Momo steering wheel and gearshift knob ($300), and the “Montreal” tire and wheel package, which consisted of gorgeous 20-inch BBS wheels and Pirelli P-Zero tires, which added a heady $6,000. The ride was jittery on uneven pavement, but handling was superb.\n\nThe one-button power top worked well, and even left a reasonable amount of trunk space when down.\n\nThe XKR is a delightful car, a bit ostentatious but prepared to deliver the performance its styling suggests. I haven’t seen Die Another Day, but I’m confident that if Bond defeats the evil Zao, it isn’t the Jaguar’s fault.\n\nBase price: $86,330\n\nPrice as tested: $93,275\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highway\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive luxury sports convertible with 4.2-liter, 390 horsepower supercharged V-8 with six-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "The vaunted name of Jaguar has seen brighter days.\n\nSales are off for the British automaker’s compact and midsize sedans, and the Ford-owned company has been hemorrhaging losses during the past few years against stiff competition from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus.\n\nJaguar recently closed its historic Browns Lane plant in Coventry, England, and ditched its Formula One racing team.\n\nBut there are still significant bright spots. And here’s one of them: the XKR sport coupe.\n\nXKR is an example of what Jaguar does so well. Taking the classically beautiful XK8, Jaguar engineers added supercharging and a sport-tuned suspension that boosts performance into true supercar territory.\n\nAlthough its curvaceous styling evokes the XK-E coupe of the 1960s, XKR is more of a fast touring car than a sports car. Acceleration is brilliant, the shrill whine of the supercharger adding to the thunderous roar of the V-8.\n\nA quick run on curving Arizona 71, which runs uphill between Winkleman and Globe, demonstrated the power and finesse of this tasty coupe.\n\nIn a shrieking tone of salsa red, XKR’s curvaceous form accented by stylish 20-inch Detroit wheels and foot-wide tires turned many heads. Those wheels, by the way, are a $6,000 option, which sort of illustrates the exclusive nature of this grand touring machine.\n\nThe fully loaded XKR, which starts at $81,330, nudges up close to the six-figure mark.\n\nThere are “R” versions of Jaguar’s sedans, with the big aluminum XJR derived from the XJ8 and the S-Type R built on the midsize car. Those are also performance machines of the first order.\n\nBut the feline form of the XKR coupled with its soaring capabilities really hits the mark. This is Jaguar as it’s meant-to-be, beauty and brawn in one desirable package.\n\nWhat it is The high-performance version of Jaguar’s XK8 coupe, XKR exemplifies the British marque’s rich heritage of racing and premium road cars.\n\nPerformance The 4.2-liter supercharged V-8 engine churns out 390 horsepower, nearly 100 more than the normally aspirated engine found in the XK8. Even for a coupe weighing nearly two tons, that’s enough pull to accelerate to 60 mph in just over five seconds, according to Jaguar’s figures.\n\nFor the uninitiated, a supercharger is a belt-driven pump that forces the air-fuel mixture into the engine’s combustion chambers, boosting horsepower and torque.\n\nWith a maximum 399 pound-feet of torque, the XKR feels muscular at any speed, roaring into action from a standstill or from 70 mph.\n\nOf course, all that power takes its toll on fuel mileage, rated by the EPA at 16 city and 23 highway, so the XKR carries a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nA six-speed automatic is the only transmission available, as it is on all XKs, the lack of a stickshift accentuating the touring nature of these cars. The automatic is nicely calibrated for performance and includes Jaguar’s unique “J” gate for manual shifts.\n\nDrivability Equipped with a handling package for more stiffness and control, the XKR feels ready to romp, with solid cornering and precise response. The package also includes a set of mighty Brembo disc brakes.\n\nStandard on the XKR is Jaguar’s Computer Active Technology Suspension ( CATS – get it?) that continuously adjusts the shock absorbers depending on road conditions, speed, hard braking and cornering forces.\n\nThe ride can get jostling at times, especially over city streets, but the firm compliance on the highway or back roads makes it worth the occasional stiff jolt.\n\nThe adaptive cruise control, which uses a radar sensor to adjust the speed automatically to traffic ahead, was abrupt and annoying. The car would rush up behind a slower vehicle, then drop speed harshly while applying the brakes. I hated it.\n\nStyling A classic form that looks sleek and refined at any angle, evoking the XK-E without being retro, the coupe is truly a gorgeous car. The coupe’s roofline is right on target.\n\nAll the R Jaguars get bright mesh grilles to differentiate them from the standard models, which is especially effective on the XKR. A louvered hood also sets it apart from the regular XK8.\n\nInterior Lush and fragrant with wood and leather, the XKR interior continues the tradition of nicely tailored Jaguar interior, in the British style. However, the controls and gauges look like they came straight off the Ford assembly line, lacking the refinement of the rest of the car.\n\nThough listed as a four-seater, the coupe is really for two humans only. The back seat is pathetically small, lacking both headroom and legroom. Consider it upholstered luggage space.\n\nThe front seats fairly tight and the ceiling is low, so that anyone with extra height or eight weight may feel cramped.\n\nThe interior is loaded with standard luxury equipment, including a navigation system standard on the XKR model.\n\nPricing Base price on the XKR is a lofty $81,330, with the test car trimmed out with that $6,000 wheel package; $3,000 for the handling package; $2,200 for adaptive cruise control; $300 for leather steering wheel and shift knob; $250 for red brake calibers; and shipping, $665.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the $1,000 gas guzzler tax, all of which push the price tag to a lofty $94,745.\n\nBottom line XKR is a lovely and powerful coupe priced out of range of most people but carrying on Jaguar’s sporting tradition.",
