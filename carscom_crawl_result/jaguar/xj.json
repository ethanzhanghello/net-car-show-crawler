      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJaguar has redesigned its flagship sedan, the XJ, for the 2010 model year, giving it exterior and interior design in the style of the XF sedan, along with the new engines introduced for the 2010 XF. The XJ competes in the full-size luxury class along with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS 460 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\n\nThe 2010 XJ comes in four models: XJ, XJL (long wheelbase), Supercharged and Supersport. Supersport models are available by special order only.\n\nExterior\nJaguar has finally given tradition a rest, abandoning the classic four-headlight front-end design that dates back decades — and that had long appeared unchanged to the untrained eye despite a complete redesign in 2004. The 2010’s nose is a more balanced execution of the XF’s prominent mesh grille and sculpted headlight clusters. The hood is dramatically domed and creased, an apparent trend across the market.\n\nViewed from the rear, the XJ would be indistinguishable as a Jaguar were it not for the large and perfectly centered chrome “leaper” emblem. The taillights look like someone grabbed a Bentley by the tail and stretched it vertically. The car looks coupe-like in profile, with a gradually sloping roofline, high rear deck and high beltline. It’s more Mercedes CLS than 2009 XJ. A notable feature is the blacked-out C-pillars (the pillars that flank the rear window). They give a floating-roof look that’s drawn mixed reviews.\n\nInterior\nThe interior also got the full XF treatment, with a more modern design, piano-black and chrome surfaces, the JaguarDrive gear selector that motors up from the center console, and virtual gauges on a 12.3-inch display. Though the tech is high, the gauges still appear as classic analog, though different instruments can be emphasized based on conditions. It’s a mix of old and new, which the interior as a whole attempts to accomplish with familiar rich leather, as well as wood trim that runs in a continuous line from the door panels across the top of the dashboard.\n\nJaguar emphasizes the feeling of light and space inside thanks to a standard panoramic glass roof. The long-wheelbase XJL offers 5 more inches of backseat legroom.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe XJ and XJL come with a standard 5.0-liter V-8 rated at 385 horsepower. The supercharged version of this 5.0-liter engine makes 470 hp in the Supercharged trim level and 510 hp in the Supersport. Jaguar’s claimed zero-to-60 mph times are 5.4, 4.9 and 4.7 seconds, respectively. Though it shares its new direct-injection power plants and six-speed automatic transmission with the XF, Jaguar says the larger XJ’s swift sprints come courtesy of a similar aerodynamic drag coefficient and lightweight aluminum construction. The XJ also includes an air-spring suspension and automatically controlled shock absorbers that vary firmness as conditions dictate.\n\nSafety\nAlong with standard safety features like antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, the XJ includes active front seat belts that snug their occupants under heavy braking or aggressive cornering. Conventional seat belt pretensioners do the same thing, only in the event of a collision.",

      "expert_review": "XJ Mixes Beauty and Brawn in its Super V8\n\nOverview\n\nThere are cars that announce who their driver is before she even steps out the doorway. The 2008 Jaguar XJ Super V8 is one of those cars. You know which one I’m talking about; it’s the model you see in your mind when you think of a Jag, and it’s beautiful.\n\nHowever, due to the Jaguar’s reputation and presence, you should probably splurge on a strand of pearls to wear while in your Jaguar. I just didn’t feel right if I wasn’t wearing a cardigan while driving it. If you’ve ever wanted to be Charlotte York Goldenblatt from “Sex and the City,” you and the XJ Super V8 will be so happy together.\n\nBut will your family be happy with it? Read on, my friends, because Charlotte’s dream car might just be yours, too.\n\nInterior\n\nOh, the Jaguar – she’ll lure you in. You’ll fall prey to her luxurious leather, walnut veneers and chrome accents. You’ll love the sound and feel of the shifter when you put the car into gear. You’ll surrender to features like ventilated seats, especially in the heat of summer.\n\nYour children will adore the backseat of the Super V8; there’s plenty of room to sprawl. There’s a fantastic center console that not only houses beverages and snacks, but also the controls for the two separate rear entertainment systems. Yep – DVD, audio and auxiliary inputs are all accepted in the Jag. No more fights or issues over who gets to watch what. Well, at least not when the screens are working, which mine weren’t, even though we could hear the movie. But my kids forgot all about “The Lion King” when they found the buttons for the power rear seats.\n\nYou’ll love the accessibility of the Latch connectors. You’ll also love the seat belt buckles that are easy for your kids to use. Your kids will love the window shades and the trays that fold down in the backseat, much like that on an airplane. They’ll actually want to do their homework in the car. Hey, whatever it takes, right? You’ll love the plush, plush carpet, and you’ll protect it with all your might from spills and goldfish crackers, right? Right? Wait, where did you go?\n\nYou might not love all the buttons, but they’re pretty easy to use and labeled clearly, so that helps. The touch-screen was also simple and easy to use (yes!). The Super V8’s power windows merit the creation of a new award: the MotherProof.com Quietest Power Window Award. They’re silent, my friends. The interior is so quiet overall that it seals your little Goldenblatts from the rest of the world.\n\nExterior\n\nThis car is beautiful, but I kind of wish my test car had been a different color. The metallic green color had a hint of teal to it that was reminiscent of the ’80s for me, but that’s a personal preference. This car is the embodiment of luxury sedan, with its lovely lines, some flashy chrome and a long-standing reputation.\n\nSpeaking of long, the Super V8 is very long. It’s a barely-fit-in-my-garage kind of long, and it has some scary-sensitive parking sensors. They beep a lot and wear on your frayed nerves. But at the end of the day, I was glad to have them because they prevented me from closing my garage door on this lovely lady.\n\nIf the sound of closing doors is your thing, you should also be aware of another newly christened XJ Super V8-inspired award: the MotherProof.com Best Door Close Sound and Feel. I loved the doors; they’re heavy but not cumbersome, and the handles and closing latches weren’t flimsy. When the door closed it said, “Madam, this door is closed securely” in a British-accented voice. I know it’s weird, but it’s true.\n\nAs I mentioned before, however, this car announces its presence. The Super V8 gets noticed, and you should be prepared for all that entails. By this I mean that you’ll get many looks from your fellow carpoolers. So you’ll probably want to wash your sweats a lot more and wear your swankiest ponytail holder or cleanest elastic headband. That can be a lot of upkeep.\n\nSafety\n\nThe XJ comes standard with front-, side-impact and side curtain airbags, as well as electronic stability control, a tire pressure monitoring system, energy-absorbent front seats and Jaguar’s Adaptive Restraint Technology System, which uses ultrasonic sensors to determine which safety systems to activate in a collision.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Jaguar XJ and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJaguar’s XJ is the marque’s flagship sedan, and it competes with the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes S-Class and Audi A8. The XJ comes in XJ8, XJ8 L, Vanden Plas, XJR, Super V8 and (new for 2009) Super V8 Portfolio models. As before, regular and extended-length versions are available.\n\nNew for 2009\nNavigation and a surround-sound system are standard across the model lineup. The XJ also gets a new high-end model called the Super V8 Portfolio.\n\nExterior\nIn front of each front door is a chrome gill that Jaguar calls a “power vent.” They echo the slats in the XK coupe. In back, a chrome strip spans the width of the trunk.\n\nThe XJ’s all-aluminum structure is a rarity even in the luxury segment, where many cars utilize a heavier steel frame. Exterior length is 200.4 inches, and it’s 73.2 inches wide. Stretched models add about 5 inches in overall length. The XJ is the narrowest sedan of its competitive set, but it’s among the longer sedans in the class.\n\n19- or 20-inch wheels\nAuto-dimming power, heated side mirrors\nAcoustic laminated glass\nBi-xenon HID headlamps with headlight washers\nAuto-leveling headlights\nFront and rear fog lamps\n\nInterior\nThe XJ’s interior is simple and elegant, if not as opulent as the high-tech cabins in the S-Class and 7 Series. The trunk has 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space, which is tied with the 7 Series as the most in the class.\n\nLeather-trimmed seats and dash\nAvailable burl walnut or elm interior trim\n320-watt, 12-speaker surround-sound system\nNavigation system\nBluetooth wireless technology\nHeated front and rear seats\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nOptional rear fold-down picnic trays\nOptional heated steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\nStandard running gear includes a V-8 engine coupled with a six-speed automatic transmission. A supercharged version of the same engine powers the XJR, allowing the vehicle to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in just 5 seconds. The XJ’s air suspension remains the same. It can automatically lower the car and maintain its balance for the best mix of performance and comfort.\n\n300-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 with 310 pounds-feet of torque\n400-hp, supercharged 4.2-liter V-8 with 413 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nAdaptive suspension\nSpeed-sensitive steering\nSport-tuned suspension with viscous limited-slip differential (XJR)\n\nSafety\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nActive front head restraints\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAntilock brakes with traction control\nElectronic stability system\nBreak-resistant glass",

      "expert_review": "If you’ve ever wanted to try the flying car found in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalog but don’t quite have $350,000, you might consider trying the $79,900 base-priced 2011 Jaguar XJL. While it doesn’t go so far as sporting foldable wings, my daughter said riding in the back of this Jag is “soooo cool; it feels just like a private jet.” She should know since at age 8 she’s clearly an expert in private jets. Ahem.\n\nShe’s right about one thing: The 2011 Jaguar XJL, the long-wheelbase version of the flagship XJ sedan, is luxurious with a capital L.\n\nAs lux as the backseat accommodations are you might be inclined to hire a driver to chauffeur you to and from the grocery store and the yoga studio. Don’t be fooled, however. The front seat is just as fabulous and enjoyable, with the exception of the tortoise-slow touch-screen multimedia center.\n\nThe driving experience in the 385-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 is as smooth as butter — the curled pats of butter dotted with pink Hawaiian volcanic sea salt that you get when flying first-class overseas. While each person’s taste in ride quality is different, the XJL’s is pure pleasure for me. It’s responsive, but soft and comfortable regardless of how rough a road you may be driving over. It must be the adaptive dynamic suspension that adjusts itself continually — as in 500 times per second — to be optimized for the road you’re driving on.\n\nAnd the very best part is the cabin is peaceful and quiet. At least it was after I dropped off my gaggle of girls at school. Practically no road or wind noise sneaks into this cockpit.\n\nThe XJL has a starting MSRP of $79,900, and my test car cost $81,450.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe XJL is sleek, smooth and aerodynamic looking. It walks that fine line between strong and sexy with the skill and grace of a Cirque du Soleil tightrope acrobat.\n\nThis car got a lot of attention during my weeklong test drive, and it was exactly the kind of attention that any busy mom deserves. When parking it with the hotel valet for a work event, the valet noticed my kids’ booster seats in the back and said, “Wow! This is a hot car for a hot mom.” Cha-ching! You can bet he got in a handsome tip for putting that sly grin on my face for the rest of the day.\n\nI also noticed a neighbor stopping outside my house, whipping out his iPhone and snapping a few not-so-discreet photos of the XJL. Yeah, none of his golf buddies are going to believe it’s his car even if it was sort of parked next to his house.\n\nThe XJL was an absolute breeze for the little ones to climb in and out of on a daily basis. Thanks to the wide-opening doors and incredible amount of legroom, they were able to clamber in even with their huge backpacks over their shoulders.\n\nThe XJL’s trunk was power operated, something you don’t see in sedans regularly. I love this feature because it allows me to open the trunk remotely when approaching the car with an armload of groceries and my other hand on my daughters to keep them from veering out into parking lot traffic. The trunk space will easily swallow a family’s groceries, backpacks, weekend bags and more.\n\nFilling this puppy up at the end of my test drive wiped the grin off my face. With its 385-hp, 5.0-liter V-8, the XJL gets an EPA-estimated 15/22 mpg city/highway and uses premium gas. It won’t be competing in any hypermiling challenges any time soon.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe five-seater’s interior fit and finish is absolutely fitting of the price tag. The black leather seats with contrast piping and stitching were soft enough to warrant being in a home library rather than a car. The gorgeous wood veneer accents echo the most beautiful hardwood floors, and the center console’s chrome trim looked like a sparkling chandelier.\n\nIn my test drive, I found the chrome gear selector, which rises up from center console, had too much form and not enough function. While I loved its looks and the clever yet simplistic turn-dial design, the chrome often reflected the bright summer sun directly into my eyes. Once or twice, I even draped my sweater over the top of the gearshift to cut down on glare. And, if parked in a sunny spot, the gear knob got so hot that I had to use the same sweater to protect my fingers from getting burned while shifting the car from Park to Drive.\n\nIn the backseat, the XJL has an immense amount of legroom (5 inches more than the XJ to be exact) and fold-down tray tables that are reminiscent of a private jet. These tables are made out of wood rather than the germ-laden plastic found in the planes I travel in. My girls got a ton of use out of the flat desk-like surface in the car. Thank-you letters were written while on the go, and a quick snack on the way to their dance camp performance was eaten without inadvertent spills on their sparkly costumes. The fold-down illuminated vanity mirrors in the backseat were also great for them to check their fancy selves out since I let them wear makeup for the performance.\n\nFamilies with youngsters also will appreciate the sunshades for the back and rear side windows in the XJL. The rear sunshade slides up and down automatically via the press of a button, while the side ones operate manually.\n\nFor total rest and relaxation, all of the five seats are heated and cooled. The front seats also have a massage feature when needed. The benefits of an in-car massage will quickly diminish, however, the second you attempt to use the center stack’s touch-screen controls. There’s a two- or three-second delay between touching the screen and the screen actually reacting to your touch. I don’t get it. If my $200 iPhone can respond to my touch immediately, why can’t this $81,450 (as tested) Jaguar? That’s just unacceptable.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nDuring the course of my week in the XJL, I pinched a nerve in my neck after sleeping on a bad hotel pillow. The XJL’s standard blind spot monitoring system was such a huge help to me when driving. Helping people with mobility issues drive safely is another bonus to blind spot monitors that I’d never before considered.\n\nAnd being a mom of three youngsters who love to spend time in the driveway drawing with sidewalk chalk, the XJL’s standard backup camera eased my concern about potential backovers.\n\nThe XJL also has standard rear-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints in the front row, and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nParents with kids of any age will be thrilled by the incredible legroom in the XJL’s backseat. Rear-facing child-safety seats fit with room to spare. However, if you’re using the Latch anchors to install child-safety seats then you’ll run into the hurdle of fighting with the seat cushions to find the actual anchors buried in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. My kids’ Britax high-back booster seats with side-impact head protection fit like a glove in the slightly bolstered rear seats. Since the seat belt buckles were on stable bases, they were able to buckle themselves in easily.

      "expert_review": "You know you’re in an impressive vehicle when a foursome of men on a Vail, Colo., golf course stop and stare as you drive by, with one of them even stopping himself mid-swing to carry out his ogling.\n\nTheir swooning was undoubtedly for the 2012 Jaguar XJL Supercharged. I couldn’t help but smirk as they gawked because while this is a car of great aesthetic appeal, the real pleasure is derived behind the wheel, and that pleasure was all mine.\n\nThe XJL Supercharged (the L is for long, and it is) offers acceleration that is wildly easy and smooth. Gear shifts are unnoticeable, and the supercharged V-8 engine maintains a sexy purr that suggests it’s a car full of talent. The XJL can conquer mountain passes with grace and style — never needing to catch its breath — but leaving those in and around it breathless in wonder.\n\nThis isn’t a sedan made with families in mind — trunk space is limited, interior storage is mediocre and the Latch anchors are tough to use. This is a car that’s about luxury and performance, and it masters those areas.\n\nHowever, it actually does manage to include a few family-friendly features: Gleaming fold-down trays on the front seats’ backs are an ideal spot for children to have a fancy after-school snack and dual vanity mirrors that float down from the ceiling provide a venue for children to make silly faces at themselves for hours on end. This car has many selling points, if you can afford it. As my son so aptly put it, “Since we have a minivan that can haul all of us, why don’t we just get one of these to have for fun?” Clearly, I am raising that kid right.\n\nThe 2012 XJL starts at $81,575, including an $875 destination charge. As-tested, the midlevel XJL Supercharged was $94,175, thanks to the addition of the Illumination Package that added a blue glow around the air vents and lit the door and trunk sills.\n\nEXTERIOR\nAs if the swooning men weren’t enough to confirm the XJL’s exterior beauty, I also received several thumbs up and approving nods while stuck in horrific Labor Day traffic. While I know this attention had nothing to do with me personally, it still made me feel sexier than usual.\n\nThe XJL is long, streamlined and sleek. At just over 206 inches in total length, this cat stretches its lithe body beautifully. It’s low enough to the ground so that children and women in skirts can gracefully slide in and out. The sizable Jaguar ornaments on the front grille and trunk are just big enough to let people know what you’re driving, but nowhere near ostentatious. Much has been made of the black D-pillars (those that flank the rear windows), and at first, I wasn’t sure about them. However, I quickly came to appreciate their overall effect in creating a soaring roof line.\n\nThe XJL Supercharged has a standard panoramic sunroof, and a standard power trunk ensures that you’ll never break a well-manicured nail when opening it. Dual exhaust pipes in the rear give a small nod to what this car is capable of on the road.\n\nStorage is one of the few areas in which I cannot rave about the XJL. The trunk is on the small side. For our Labor Day jaunt to the hills, we were unable to fit all that we needed in the car. Thankfully, we sucked it up because driving the car up the mountain roads provided more enjoyment than whatever it was we didn’t bring. (A stroller? A bike? Who cares?).\n\nThe XJL Supercharged has a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine that produces 470 horsepower. The engine is matched to a six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters, and fuel economy is EPA-estimated at 15/22 mpg city/highway. It uses premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nIf you haven’t already stopped reading this review to go test-drive the XJL Supercharged, it’s your loss. If you’re still reading, then it will come as no surprise that the XJL comes with a luxurious, elegant interior. All the better to envelop you as you swiftly glide over the streets.\n\nPiano-black surfaces, soft leather upholstery with cream-colored piping, front seats that heat, cool and massage and a crescent line of walnut wood atop the leather dash ease you into the cabin.\n\nThe circular gear selector rises from the center console area when the engine starts and retreats when the engine is turned off. An 8-inch screen sits prominently in the center stack and offers a wealth of technological features that are easy and intuitive to manage.\n\nThe cabin is particularly elegant in the evening with everything dimly lit. It’s quiet, enticing and sexy. When in Drive, the speedometer illuminates only the two speeds which you’re between, leaving the rest of the numbers darkened, and with the optional Illumination Package, the circular vents come rimmed in faint blue light. The cabin is also nice and quiet day or night — unless your kids are with you and then it’s never that quiet.\n\nLike the trunk, the center console is also on the small side. There are only four cupholders and the door pockets are kind of measly.\n\nSince this is the XJL, there’s an additional five inches of legroom in the rear. This means plenty of room for even the largest and longest of adults to doze off back there or for children to play a few rounds of duck-duck-goose. That’s a slight exaggeration, but there is room to spread out.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 XJL has two sets of lower Latch anchors. Using them wasn’t as smooth as everything else about this car. They’re buried in the most inflexible part of the leather seat cushions and require some profanity to employ. Three child-safety seats won’t fit across the backseat, but rear-facing car seats fit easily in the XJL.\n\nThe XJL has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, auto-leveling adaptive bi-xenon headlights, an electronic stability system with traction control, a blind spot warning system, active front head restraints, front and rear parking sensors, a backup camera and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Adaptive cruise control is optional.\n\nA few other notable features that come with every XJL are an automatic speed limiter, keyless entry and a seat belt monitor that chimes and tells you which seating position isn’t buckled up. Kids!\n\nThe 2012 XJL hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Jaguar XJL here.",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: The 2016 Jaguar XJ is stylish, dynamic and an unexpected value in its class, especially considering Jaguar’s excellent warranty. But the sedan’s tendency for glitches might put that warranty to good use.\n\nVersus the competition: The XJ prioritizes performance over isolation, a sure turnoff for anyone who prefers the coddling comforts of certain top-shelf sedans. It lacks the technological opulence that others boast, too — but before Jaguar makes that leap, it needs to iron out a few bugs with its existing tech.\n\nThe XJ comes in regular or extended wheelbases with rear- or all-wheel drive, which you can compare here. Jaguar tweaked the XJ’s styling and updated its multimedia system for 2016; compare it with the 2015 XJ here. Engines range from a supercharged V-6 to two supercharged V-8s. We drove an extended-length XJ with the lesser of the V-8s. (That’s a comparative adjective only; this sedan still hauls.)\nExterior & Styling\nRefreshed with new headlights and a reshaped lower bumper with new brightwork, the XJ remains a sharp-looking sedan, at least from the nose. Jaguar changed little in back — a missed opportunity, as the rest of the brand’s lineup has some variation of the F-Type roadster’s athletic taillights. The XJ’s tail retains its bulbous shape and drooping lights. Taken as a whole, they make even the largest available wheels (20-inchers) look undersized.\n\nAn extended-wheelbase version increases total length by about 5 inches. The range-topping XJR model, which has the highest-output V-8, adds hood vents, quad tailpipes and a body-colored lower rear bumper; it also loses some brightwork up front.\nHow It Drives\nThanks to an all-aluminum body, the XJ weighs hundreds of pounds less than its German peers and the benefits are obvious. The extended-wheelbase car changes direction with a degree of precision that seems incompatible with its 206.9-inch length. (That’s longer than a Mercedes-Benz S-Class — or a Chevy Tahoe, for that matter.) Steering turn-in is immediate and the wheel exhibits smooth, natural feedback without requiring too much effort at low speeds. The nose tracks well through sweeping curves and the tail is seldom skittish when you lay on the gas. After an inch or so of initial pedal travel, the brakes are strong.\n\nStill, I wish Jaguar accompanied this with better ride quality. The current XJ has always ridden on the firm side of the class and that was still true on this test drive. Adaptive shock absorbers all around with air springs over the rear are standard, but the sum of it allows a degree of disturbance at highway speeds that’s a far cry from the isolating suspensions in the S-Class and BMW 7 Series. Even in its softest settings, the XJ’s suspension doesn’t soak up manhole covers and major potholes in a way befitting a full-size luxury sedan. The Lexus LS and Audi A8 ride on the firm side of the class, too, but Jaguar may have staked out even firmer territory.\n\nEven with the lesser V-8, the XJ boasts a prodigious 470 horsepower and its acceleration should leave no question about that figure. Revs are smooth and swift, with immediate accelerator response from a stop — a welcome characteristic in a class where gradual accelerator response, or just plain lag, is the norm. The drivetrain lacks the head-snapping torque of the BMW 750i, but nobody should want for more power in the Jaguar.\n\nWe’ve criticized Jaguar’s switch from an excellent six-speed automatic to an indecisive eight-speed unit in the past but, in the 2016 XJ, Jaguar seems to have improved on the transmission’s missteps. The eight-speed upshifts quickly and downshifts with little lag, kicking down a few gears at once if necessary.\n\nThe XJ offers two other supercharged engines: a 340-hp V-6 or 550-hp V-8. We’ve driven the former (read the review here) and it should satisfy most people. On the other end, Jaguar says the top-dog V-8 gets the XJ to 60 mph in a scant 4.4 seconds. That’s fierce acceleration, though some rivals’ quickest versions hit the mark in the 3-second range.\nInterior\nCabin materials are expectedly lush, but taller drivers should note that headroom is modest. With the driver’s seat elevated to my liking, my hair kept brushing the headliner (I’m 6 feet tall). Extended-wheelbase models get quilted leather seats, but I could never get the hard backrests to conform to my body during our time in the XJ. Visibility is limited, too, with a tiny rear window and shallow windshield rake that puts the A-pillars in your forward view.\n\nA panoramic moonroof is standard, as are a power-adjustable steering column and heating and ventilation for the front and rear seats — rare features to have standard, even in a flagship sedan. XJR models have sport seats with more aggressive bolstering.\n\nThe rear seats have abundant legroom and a supportive seat height, though headroom is still modest. Buy the extended-wheelbase XJ and you can opt for a two-position backseat with power-adjustable outboard seats, massagers, separate climate zones and a rear entertainment system with dual 10.2-inch screens, USB and HDMI ports, and folding tables.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe XJ’s 8-inch dashboard display supports pinch-and-swipe operation and has a row of physical buttons beneath it. Our test car, however, had a seemingly endless sequence of electronic glitches. The multimedia system would occasionally (and inexplicably) take an eternity to get past Jaguar’s startup banner and into any submenus. One editor observed the entire system freeze and restart while he was driving. On another occasion, the backup camera failed to activate, producing a black screen while I reversed the old-fashioned way. After I shifted back into Drive, the screen finally rebooted itself. In another instance, the camera refused to activate despite shifting into Reverse multiple times.\n\nThe stereo had its own gremlins, switching inexplicably between Bluetooth streaming audio and the radio at one point, then dropping satellite radio despite no signal obstruction in two other cases. Ultimately, the satellite radio failed altogether and never returned.\n\nHD radio, Bluetooth audio and phone connectivity, a USB port and Meridian surround-sound audio are standard. In-car Wi-Fi and upgraded Meridian audio are optional. Jaguar’s InControl Apps platform runs applications off a compatible iPhone or Android smartphone, but the XJ doesn’t offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nIn place of analog gauges, the XJ has a 12.3-inch virtual instrument panel that can show similar gauges or full-screen navigation maps. The latter feature is similar to Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, though it lacks Audi’s Google Earth overlays.\nCargo & Storage\nTypical of high-end luxury sedans, the XJ is meager on cabin storage areas. Trunk volume is 15.2 cubic feet. It’s an unremarkable figure for the segment, but it’s fairly deep. A power trunk lid is standard.\nSafety\nThe XJ has not been crash-tested, a status that’s unlikely to change because of its limited sales volume. A blind spot warning system and a backup camera with front and rear parking sensors are standard; 360-degree cameras are optional. Full-speed adaptive cruise control and self-parking systems are optional, as is forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.\nValue in Its Class\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve had a buggy XJ and that should concern anyone who plans to buy, not just lease, the sedan. If our experience is any indication, the glitches could extend well beyond the warranty period. That said, Jaguar furnishes one heck of a warranty: five years or 60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage, with free scheduled maintenance the whole time. That should go a long way toward soothing problems large and small.\n\nPricing for the XJ runs from around $75,000 to north of $130,000 with all options. That’s a reasonable range as top-shelf luxury sedans go, especially given the XJ’s generous standard features. Jaguar’s range-topping sedan lacks the serenity of an S-Class or the technological spectacle of the new 7 Series and, if money is little object, both competitors are better all-around choices. But the XJ’s drivability still stands out. That, plus some big savings, might entice certain shoppers.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The older my kids get, the more I feel like their chauffer more than their parent. Never has this been truer than in the Jaguar XJL.\n\nThe 2015 Jaguar XJL is a car that anyone (including myself) would want to be driven around in, but it’s just as pleasurable from the driver’s seat — apart from one major oversight.\n\nThe L in “XJL” stands for “long wheelbase,” which primarily adds backseat legroom to the standard-wheelbase XJ. There’s also an XJR, the sportiest version, available in short- and long-wheelbase models.\n\nThe XJL comes in two trim levels: Portfolio and Supercharged. The Portfolio offers optional all-wheel drive in lieu of the Jaguar’s standard rear-wheel drive; this is the version I tested. Compare the three XJR versions side by side here.\n\nThis year’s model remains relatively unchanged from last year’s, although the 2014 version received quite a few adjustments from the 2013 model year. Check them out side by side here.\n\nFor those in the market for a swanky, uber-lux sedan, you may also want to research the Audi A8 or Mercedes-Benz S-Class. See them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe XJL impresses with its commanding looks and strong, lean, feminine curves. If this car were a person, it would be athletic ballerina Misty Copeland in her viral Under Armour ad: long, muscular and graceful in her sheer strength.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe most surprising thing was how nimble, light and easy the XJL was to drive. With a sedan of this size, I definitely came into it expecting something much more unruly and unpleasant. While driving, though, the only time I noticed how big this car is was when trying to turn around in a tight circle to pull out of my driveway. The turning circle in the all-wheel-drive XJL is 42.3 feet, shrinking a bit to 40.4 feet with rear-wheel drive. Those who would like to actively avoid the embarrassing three-point turn should consider the standard-wheelbase XJ and its tighter turning circles: 40.7 feet with all-wheel drive and 39.0 feet with rear-wheel drive.\n\nThe 340-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine makes the XJL fast when you want it to be, but it’s just as easy to slow-roll through the ‘burbs on the way to Sunday brunch. The stop-start technology, which is designed to help save fuel, is a bit rough around the edges, however, and managed to startle me with each stop and start.\n\nThe “intuitive” all-wheel drive in my test XJL also could have used some more … ahem … intuition. After a snowstorm, my test car felt a little skippy when transitioning between ice and dry pavement in my driveway. It felt as if the wheels had to slip a fraction of a second too long before transferring power to the wheels with traction.\n\nAnd one last piece of constructive criticism: The park assist sensors in my XJL beeped to let me know there was something in front of me, even when I was in Reverse and had clearly moved away from the obstruction. This happened every time I reversed out of a parking spot at the grocery store. The car should be smart enough to know not to alert me about something that’s not a danger; it became difficult to decipher which beeps were relevant and which I should ignore.\n\nThe XJL Portfolio with all-wheel drive gets an EPA-estimated 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gas. This reflects a substantial highway penalty versus the rear-wheel-drive XJL Portfolio’s estimated 17/27/20 mpg. Note that the XJL Supercharged is powered by a 470-hp, supercharged V-8 (it was named long before the lesser engine was itself supercharged). It’s rated 15/23/18 mpg and is available only with rear-wheel drive.\n\nFor comparison, the Audi A8 L with its base engine and standard all-wheel drive gets an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined. The Mercedes S550, which comes in just one length (it’s comparable to its competitors’ extended versions), is rated 20 mpg combined with rear-wheel drive and 19 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nInterior\nThe XJL feels as luxurious as it should for its price tag. The interior is wrapped in beautiful tones and textures of leather that invite you to pet it and purr (though I’d recommend refraining from this when you have guests in your car). My test car had light gray leather seats with dark gray contrast piping and stitching; a dark gray leather-wrapped center console and dash with light gray contrast stitching; and a tan suedelike headliner.\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention the leather door panels that, according to Jaguar, are “inspired by premium, hand-stitched designer briefcases.” I’ve never owned a briefcase, so I can’t say if Jaguar nailed this or not, but I can confirm that they do look lovely. To further customize your XJL, you can choose among 11 wood trim options.\n\nUp front, the standard heated steering wheel definitely got its fair share of use during my week driving the XJL. The front seats are incredibly comfortable and luxurious enough to transport government dignitaries, celebrities or even just my 14-year-old daughter. Storage is limited to a small center console, a small storage tray with a cover in front of the console, and two cupholders with covers you can slide closed when not in use.\n\nThe rotary dial gearshift fits into the upscale appeal of the XJL and rises up when you start the car. It retracts down and out of the way when you shut down.\n\nThe XJL’s most impressive story is its backseat. The long wheelbase adds an incredible 5.1 inches of rear legroom, bringing the total up to 44.1 inches. This beats out Mercedes’ S-Class, which has 43.0 inches, and thumbs its nose at the Audi A8’s bourgeois-feeling 42.9 inches of rear legroom. With my teenager in the front passenger seat, my two younger girls (ages 10 and 12) were thrilled with the enormous amount of space to stretch out and lounge around in. Throw in the standard heated and cooled rear seats and my kids start getting a little too pampered. Could someone please feed them some chilled grapes?\n\nThe backseat has a center armrest that folds down, revealing two cupholders and two small storage bins. In-door “briefcase-inspired” storage, as well as pockets on the front seatbacks, gives your royalty plenty of places to store their riches, or just their math workbooks.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nSadly, the XJL falls flat when it comes to usability of its “intuitive infotainment” system, which controls everything from the audio system and navigation to climate settings throughout the vehicle.\n\nThe touch-screen control panel lags behind, waiting a second or two after it’s been touched to respond. When you try, for example, to quickly scroll through radio stations, there’s a delay before the screen reacts to what you want it to do. It kind of makes me want to slap it like I do my phone when the maps app stops behaving properly — but then I remember that this car costs several tens of thousands of dollars more than my little iPhone and I refrain. (The slapping never really seems to help, anyway.)\n\nIn additional to unresponsiveness, the system is just too complicated to do something as simple as turn on the seat heater — something I do every day for months on end. I have to toggle through multiple menu screens and go through three separate onscreen “button” touches before getting it to turn on, all while navigating around school buses and headphone-wearing teenagers crossing the street in the school zone. The system requires too much eye time away from the road to operate thoroughly and safely, unless your personal assistant is along for the ride doing it all for you.\n\nThe massaging front seats in my test car (an $800 option) were almost blissful enough to distract me into forgetting about the above annoyances, but given I couldn’t safely turn on the massaging seats while driving, I resisted the bliss.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith 15.2 cubic feet of trunk space, the Jaguar XJL was more than accommodating enough for my family’s daily haul of backpacks and sleepover bags, as well as a weekly grocery haul. For even more space, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has 16.3 cubic feet of trunk space, whereas the Audi A8 has just 13.2.\n\nA powered trunk lid is standard, and the lid opening height is programmable.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Jaguar XJL has not been crash-tested.\n\nBlind spot warning and a backup camera are standard features on the XJL. They’re features I deem absolutely necessary, especially given the decreased rear visibility from the XJL’s swoopy lines. Front and rear park-assist sensors are also standard, alerting the driver with both a tone and a visual cue on the touch-screen to any obstructions in front of or behind the vehicle.\n\nMy test car did not come with the XJL’s available adaptive cruise control system, but on vehicles with this option, an advanced collision warning system “watches” ahead for any possible impending collisions. It will alert the driver and pre-charge the brakes to provide maximum stopping power when the driver does apply them.\n\nMy test car came with an optional $850 Visibility Package, which includes my new favorite feature: intelligent high-beam lights that automatically switch between high beams when needed and regular lights when another car is approaching. Also part of this package is adaptive front lighting that pivots the headlights in the direction of a turn to keep the lights on the road, as well as illuminating an additional cornering light outboard of either headlight when you turn your turn signal on to light up the road onto which you’re turning.\n\nFamilies brave enough to install child-safety seats on the XJL’s beautiful leather seat will be thrilled with the amount of legroom even for bulky rear-facing car seats. However, the lower Latch system anchors (located in the two outboard seating positions) are deeply buried within the seat bight, with virtually no clearance on top to work fingers and Latch connectors into.\n\nThe seat belt buckles in the backseat are nearly flush with the bottom cushions, which may make it tricky for independent youngsters in booster seats to buckle up on their own.\n\nSee all the XJL’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWhile the XJL warrants its price tag with its beautiful upscale fit and finish, plus general seating and driving comfort, at this price a consumer won’t be willing to turn a blind eye to oversights. In this case, the XJL’s practically unusable multimedia system would prevent me from delving in. Where’s that rumored Apple dashboard when you need it?\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2016 about the 2016 Jaguar XJ, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe XJ comes in regular or extended wheelbases with rear- or all-wheel drive, which you can compare here. Jaguar tweaked the XJ’s styling and updated its multimedia system for 2016; compare it with the 2015 XJ here. Engines range from a supercharged V-6 to two supercharged V-8s. We drove an extended-length XJ with the lesser of the V-8s. (That’s a comparative adjective only; this sedan still hauls.)\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nRefreshed with new headlights and a reshaped lower bumper with new brightwork, the XJ remains a sharp-looking sedan, at least from the nose. Jaguar changed little in back — a missed opportunity, as the rest of the brand’s lineup has some variation of the F-Type roadster’s athletic taillights. The XJ’s tail retains its bulbous shape and drooping lights. Taken as a whole, they make even the largest available wheels (20-inchers) look undersized.\n\nAn extended-wheelbase version increases total length by about 5 inches. The range-topping XJR model, which has the highest-output V-8, adds hood vents, quad tailpipes and a body-colored lower rear bumper; it also loses some brightwork up front.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThanks to an all-aluminum body, the XJ weighs hundreds of pounds less than its German peers and the benefits are obvious. The extended-wheelbase car changes direction with a degree of precision that seems incompatible with its 206.9-inch length. (That’s longer than a Mercedes-Benz S-Class — or a Chevy Tahoe, for that matter.) Steering turn-in is immediate and the wheel exhibits smooth, natural feedback without requiring too much effort at low speeds. The nose tracks well through sweeping curves and the tail is seldom skittish when you lay on the gas. After an inch or so of initial pedal travel, the brakes are strong.\n\nStill, I wish Jaguar accompanied this with better ride quality. The current XJ has always ridden on the firm side of the class and that was still true on this test drive. Adaptive shock absorbers all around with air springs over the rear are standard, but the sum of it allows a degree of disturbance at highway speeds that’s a far cry from the isolating suspensions in the S-Class and BMW 7 Series. Even in its softest settings, the XJ’s suspension doesn’t soak up manhole covers and major potholes in a way befitting a full-size luxury sedan. The Lexus LS and Audi A8 ride on the firm side of the class, too, but Jaguar may have staked out even firmer territory.\n\nEven with the lesser V-8, the XJ boasts a prodigious 470 horsepower and its acceleration should leave no question about that figure. Revs are smooth and swift, with immediate accelerator response from a stop — a welcome characteristic in a class where gradual accelerator response, or just plain lag, is the norm. The drivetrain lacks the head-snapping torque of the BMW 750i, but nobody should want for more power in the Jaguar.\n\nWe’ve criticized Jaguar’s switch from an excellent six-speed automatic to an indecisive eight-speed unit in the past but, in the 2016 XJ, Jaguar seems to have improved on the transmission’s missteps. The eight-speed upshifts quickly and downshifts with little lag, kicking down a few gears at once if necessary.\n\nThe XJ offers two other supercharged engines: a 340-hp V-6 or 550-hp V-8. We’ve driven the former (read the review here) and it should satisfy most people. On the other end, Jaguar says the top-dog V-8 gets the XJ to 60 mph in a scant 4.4 seconds. That’s fierce acceleration, though some rivals’ quickest versions hit the mark in the 3-second range.\n\nInterior\n\nCabin materials are expectedly lush, but taller drivers should note that headroom is modest. With the driver’s seat elevated to my liking, my hair kept brushing the headliner (I’m 6 feet tall). Extended-wheelbase models get quilted leather seats, but I could never get the hard backrests to conform to my body during our time in the XJ. Visibility is limited, too, with a tiny rear window and shallow windshield rake that puts the A-pillars in your forward view.\n\nA panoramic moonroof is standard, as are a power-adjustable steering column and heating and ventilation for the front and rear seats — rare features to have standard, even in a flagship sedan. XJR models have sport seats with more aggressive bolstering.\n\nThe rear seats have abundant legroom and a supportive seat height, though headroom is still modest. Buy the extended-wheelbase XJ and you can opt for a two-position backseat with power-adjustable outboard seats, massagers, separate climate zones and a rear entertainment system with dual 10.2-inch screens, USB and HDMI ports, and folding tables.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe XJ’s 8-inch dashboard display supports pinch-and-swipe operation and has a row of physical buttons beneath it. Our test car, however, had a seemingly endless sequence of electronic glitches. The multimedia system would occasionally (and inexplicably) take an eternity to get past Jaguar’s startup banner and into any submenus. One editor observed the entire system freeze and restart while he was driving. On another occasion, the backup camera failed to activate, producing a black screen while I reversed the old-fashioned way. After I shifted back into Drive, the screen finally rebooted itself. In another instance, the camera refused to activate despite shifting into Reverse multiple times.\n\nThe stereo had its own gremlins, switching inexplicably between Bluetooth streaming audio and the radio at one point, then dropping satellite radio despite no signal obstruction in two other cases. Ultimately, the satellite radio failed altogether and never returned.\n\nHD radio, Bluetooth audio and phone connectivity, a USB port and Meridian surround-sound audio are standard. In-car Wi-Fi and upgraded Meridian audio are optional. Jaguar’s InControl Apps platform runs applications off a compatible iPhone or Android smartphone, but the XJ doesn’t offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nIn place of analog gauges, the XJ has a 12.3-inch virtual instrument panel that can show similar gauges or full-screen navigation maps. The latter feature is similar to Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, though it lacks Audi’s Google Earth overlays.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nTypical of high-end luxury sedans, the XJ is meager on cabin storage areas. Trunk volume is 15.2 cubic feet. It’s an unremarkable figure for the segment, but it’s fairly deep. A power trunk lid is standard.\n\nSafety\n\nThe XJ has not been crash-tested, a status that’s unlikely to change because of its limited sales volume. A blind spot warning system and a backup camera with front and rear parking sensors are standard; 360-degree cameras are optional. Full-speed adaptive cruise control and self-parking systems are optional, as is forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve had a buggy XJ and that should concern anyone who plans to buy, not just lease, the sedan. If our experience is any indication, the glitches could extend well beyond the warranty period. That said, Jaguar furnishes one heck of a warranty: five years or 60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage, with free scheduled maintenance the whole time. That should go a long way toward soothing problems large and small.\n\nPricing for the XJ runs from around $75,000 to north of $130,000 with all options. That’s a reasonable range as top-shelf luxury sedans go, especially given the XJ’s generous standard features. Jaguar’s range-topping sedan lacks the serenity of an S-Class or the technological spectacle of the new 7 Series and, if money is little object, both competitors are better all-around choices. But the XJ’s drivability still stands out. That, plus some big savings, might entice certain shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Jaguar XJ still boasts tasteful, minimalistic luxury, but its once-standout drivability has lost a step, and reliability issues should concern anyone looking to buy rather than lease one.\n\nIn the march toward better gas mileage, even top-flight luxury sedans have been dropping their standard V-8s. The latest is the Jaguar XJ, which teams a new, supercharged V-6 with a new eight-speed automatic. The combination delivers decent EPA-estimated gas mileage, and newly available all-wheel drive should further the appeal for snow-state shoppers.\n\nAlas, this cat doesn’t land cleanly on its feet.\n\nThe XJ comes in nine varieties, from regular-wheelbase XJs to extended XJLs. The supercharged V-6 pairs with rear- or all-wheel drive. Normally aspirated and supercharged V-8s are also available, but they come only with rear-wheel drive. Compare them here, or stack up the 2012 and 2013 XJ here. We drove a regular-wheelbase XJ with the supercharged V-6 and all-wheel drive.\n\nIs Six Better than Eight?\nImprovements on paper aren’t always improvements on pavement. Last year’s XJ employed a six-speed automatic, a longtime Jaguar setup that kicked down instantaneously and intuitively when heading into corners (read our review of it here). The eight-speed that replaces it immediately feels inferior. Its capabilities are impressive; it’s able to downshift five gears in one fell swoop rather than stepping down through the gears. But doing so takes a strong jab to the gas; most of the time the automatic stays in higher gears and resists downshifts until long after you called for them.\n\nMore vexing are hints of accelerator lag from the get-go, though they’re better than in some competitors, particularly the current Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which will be replaced by a 2014 redesign. A Sport mode in the XJ retains lower gears and quells some of the lag; so does a selectable Dynamic mode, which sharpens drivetrain and adaptive suspension settings. Both settings help a bit, but I’d gladly opt for last year’s six-speed, which also came without the XJ’s newest “advancement”: an automatic stop-start function that’s intrusive enough passengers will ask you if something broke. You can turn it off, but it cycles back on the next time you get in the car. Bah.\n\nThe other six — the supercharged V-6 — is worth keeping. With 340 horsepower and a handy 332 pounds-feet of torque, it provides plentiful, smooth-revving power. Jaguar says the all-wheel-drive XJ V-6 hits 60 mph in 6.1 seconds — modest for this crowd, given the six-cylinder BMW 740i and Audi A8 3.0T make it there in the mid-5s — but it’s still plenty quick. EPA gas mileage, which is as high as 18/27 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and the V-6, is comparable with these German models. All-wheel drive drops the XJ’s mileage clear down to a not-so-competitive 16/24 mpg.\n\nRide & Handling\nAn adaptive suspension is standard, but it rides on the firm side. Dynamic mode firms up the ride even more, but it also quells the XJ’s modest body roll. Those seeking a plusher ride should try the 7 Series, S-Class or versions of the Lexus LS with its adaptive suspension option.\n\nEven with the V-6, the XJ still feels light on its feet; the steering directs the nose with instinctive precision, and expert drivers can tame hints of understeer through sweeping corners with a dab of gas. Still, one editor found the XJ too nose-heavy, its tires unable to keep the car in line. Models with the supercharged V-8 add an active rear differential that funnels power left or right to improve handling, which may help the dynamics.\n\nThe XJ may be full size, but it drives like a smaller, lighter car. And it is lighter than many competitors — by a lot — thanks to extensive aluminum construction. Curb weight ranges from less than 3,900 pounds to just over 4,200. The lightest BMW 7 Series and Audi A8 start 97 and 163 pounds heavier, respectively, than the heaviest XJ. Mercedes-Benz has yet to provide weight specs for the redesigned 2014 S-Class, but the lightest version of its portly predecessor weighed 417 pounds more than the heaviest XJ. The heaviest Lexus LS balloons past 5,200 pounds, which is at least 989 pounds heavier than any XJ. Amid these fat-cats, only the Porsche Panamera falls in Jaguar territory. And even then, the XJ is lighter by a hair.\n\nThe brakes stop things with firm, linear pedal feel, too, and that’s with the XJ’s standard antilock discs. Supercharged V-8 models upgrade to massive 15-inch front and 14.8-inch rear discs — all the better to lasso the car’s 470 or 510 hp, depending on trim. (Last year’s 385-hp, normally aspirated V-8 is still available, but only in the rear-drive XJL Portfolio.) Jaguar says the quickest XJ hits 60 mph in 4.7 seconds, which should be powerful enough for anyone this side of insanity. That didn’t stop Mercedes and Audi from building quicker cars still; the S65 AMG takes 4.2 seconds, and the S8 flits there in just 3.9. On hiatus since 2009, Jaguar’s ultimate XJ, the XJR, will re-emerge for 2014 with an estimated 4.4-second sprint to 60 mph.\n\nThe Inside\nAn exercise in minimalism, the XJ’s interior has aged well. A leather-bound dashboard rises gently toward the windshield; polished wood juts below the glass, extending around the doors. The center display is a straightforward touch-screen rather than using the knob-based controllers Mercedes, Audi, Lexus and BMW insist on having. The seats offer good comfort, though one editor thought they bordered on being too narrow. Backseat legroom was snug in our regular-wheelbase test car. With another 5.2 inches of rear legroom, the extended-wheelbase XJL solves that problem, and then some.\n\nAlas, our test car had its share of shortcomings — some by design, others less explainable gremlins. Jaguar augmented the standard navigation system for 2013 with more functions, and it now requires fewer actions for basic commands, but the touch-screen still lags too long between menus. Behind the steering wheel, the simulated gauges looked OK when the current XJ first arrived, but seem too low-res now. Then come our car’s glitches, which ranged from an abrupt loss of satellite radio signal with no apparent skyward obstructions (we stopped and restarted the car, and the signal returned) to loose trim in the trunk and odd electrical problems. One channel of the Meridian stereo was dead when using the analog MP3 jack and portable players; another reviewer said he powered his seat forward and the driver’s-side window promptly lowered.\n\nReliability, Safety & Features\nSuch is our concern for a car whose current generation has received dismal reliability ratings in both J.D. Power and Associates’ three-year Vehicle Dependability Study and Consumer Reports’ reliability surveys. Informed of our test-car’s problems, Jaguar representatives pointed toward the brand’s scores in J.D. Power’s 90-day Initial Quality Study, which showed dramatic improvement in 2012. Still, IQS tracks problems as well as owner dislikes, which undermines its credibility as a strict reliability gauge.\n\nThe XJ has not been crash-tested, and due to a low sales volume, it’s unlikely it will be. Standard safety features include front, front-seat side-impact and side curtain airbags, plus a blind spot warning system and the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Adaptive headlights with automatic high-beams are optional. So is adaptive cruise control, which has a forward collision alert that warns of obstructions but doesn’t apply braking, as some systems do. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nPricing for the XJ starts around $75,000. Standard features include leather upholstery with heated front and rear seats, power front seats, a navigation system, a panoramic moonroof, a Meridian stereo and a backup camera with front and rear parking sensors. Ventilated front seats with additional power adjustments and massagers are optional and, typical of a top-shelf luxury car, the sky’s the limit when it comes to backseat amenities — ranging from dual-zone rear climate control and ventilated, massaging seats to power seat adjusters, folding tables, footrests and sunshades. Go hog wild and the XJ can climb well into the six-figure range.\n\nXJ in the Market\nAnyone shopping a full-size luxury sedan should consider waiting for the segment stalwart — Mercedes’ redesigned 2014 S-Class — to show up in September for a comparative test drive. Even then, the XJ may still entice on how it drives alone. As for reliability, Jaguar’s four-year/50,000-mile warranty includes free maintenance, so the vast majority of expenses should be covered over the life of a typical lease — the way many XJs find buyers.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Jaguar XJ?\n\nJaguar’s flagship sedan, the full-size XJ, is made of aluminum and is offered in regular- and long-wheelbase form, the latter with 5 extra inches of rear legroom. The XJ is available with rear- or all-wheel drive and is powered by a 340-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine or a 470-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8. There’s also a high-performance XJR575 that cranks out 575 hp and launches from zero-to-60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. The XJ competes against the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Jaguar XJ?\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are now available as part of an optional Smartphone Package. Automatic emergency braking is now standard, and Jaguar’s InControl Touch Pro multimedia system has updated graphics. The navigation system adds voice command capability, too.\n\nTo commemorate 50 years of the XJ, there’s a new XJ50 Special Edition available only in long-wheelbase form, but with the supercharged V-6 or V-8. Inside and out, the XJ50 wears unique badging and gets other exclusive cues.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Jaguar XJ Are Most Important?\n\nThe XJ offers a wealth of available luxury features, including massaging rear seats, a dual-screen rear entertainment system and power sunshades for the rear side windows. Standard active safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, a driver drowsiness monitor and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Jaguar XJ?\n\nEach player in the luxury full-size sedan segment continues to offer a comfortable flavor of its own, with the XJ being more on the sporty end of the spectrum as far as the driving experience is concerned. However, if you're shopping this class, we'd recommend test-driving the S-Class and 7 Series before making your decision.",
