      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe Jaguar F-Pace is a five-seat compact luxury SUV for car shoppers who want the space of an SUV and the handling of a sports sedan. Its quick reflexes make the F-Pace a joy to drive, particularly along tight and twisty roads. The engine lineup consists of a standard 246-horsepower, turbo four-cylinder; a turbocharged and supercharged mild-hybrid inline-six with 395 hp; and a mighty 567-hp, supercharged V-8 in the range-topping SVR trim. All-wheel drive is standard. F-Pace competitors include the BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Genesis GV70, Lexus NX, Lincoln Corsair, Porsche Macan and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe high-performance SVR trim gets an additional 25 hp; it was previously rated at 542 hp. Jaguar has announced that the F-Pace will be discontinued after the 2025 model year, as the brand plans to transition to an all-electric model lineup.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jaguar F-Pace Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-speaker Meridian audio system\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear parking sensors\n19-inch wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nAmazon Alexa\nHead-up instrument display\nWi-Fi hot spot\n16-way power-adjustable front seats\nActive sports exhaust (SVR)\nAdaptive suspension\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe Jaguar F-Pace certainly leans toward the sporty side of the SUV spectrum, which is ideal if your priorities include a well-balanced ride, sharp steering responses and a variety of engine choices. It can feel harsh over rough pavement, but most owners will accept the compromise for its engaging driving experience. We think the base turbo-four will be acceptable to most car shoppers, but the thunderous supercharged V-8 in the F-Pace SVR is an absolute riot — so long as you don’t mind its sky-high price or thirst for fuel. Though there might be some charm in the F-Pace’s last-of-a-breed status, note that this SUV debuted for the 2017 model year and hasn’t seen any major revisions since; almost all of its rivals have newer, more up-to-date designs.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe Jaguar F-Pace is a five-seat compact luxury SUV for car shoppers who want the space of an SUV with the handling of a sports sedan. Its quick reflexes make the F-Pace a joy to drive, particularly along tight and twisty roads. The engine lineup consists of a standard 246-horsepower, turbo four-cylinder; a turbocharged and supercharged mild-hybrid inline-six with 395 hp; and a mighty 542-hp, supercharged V-8 in the range-topping SVR trim. All-wheel drive is standard. F-Pace competitors include the BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Genesis GV70, Lexus NX, Lincoln Corsair, Porsche Macan and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe F-Pace model lineup has been pared down to include only sport-tuned R-Dynamic trims and the high-performance SVR. The Black Exterior Pack, which adds sporty trim, is now standard, as are a heated steering wheel, additional power sockets and a black headliner. Jaguar’s Pivi Pro infotainment system, which includes over-the-air updates, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and a wireless charging pad, is now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Jaguar F-Pace Are Most Important?\n\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-speaker Meridian audio system\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear parking sensors\n19-inch wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nAmazon Alexa\nHead-up instrument display\nWi-Fi hot spot\n16-way power-adjustable front seats\nActive sports exhaust (SVR)\nAdaptive suspension\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe Jaguar F-Pace certainly leans toward the sporty side of the SUV spectrum, which is ideal if your priorities include a well-balanced ride, sharp steering responses and a variety of engine choices. It can feel harsh over rough pavement, but most owners will accept the compromise for its engaging driving experience. We think the base turbo-four will be acceptable to most car shoppers, but the thunderous supercharged V-8 in the F-Pace SVR is an absolute riot — so long as you don’t mind its sky-high price or thirst for fuel.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe 2023 Jaguar F-Pace is a great five-seat compact luxury SUV for car shoppers who want the space of an SUV but the handling of a sport sedan. Its quick reflexes make the F-Pace a joy to drive, particularly along tight and twisty roads. The engine lineup consists of a standard 246-horsepower, turbo four-cylinder; a turbocharged and supercharged 395-hp mild-hybrid inline-six; and a mighty 542-hp supercharged V-8 in the range-topping SVR trim. The 335-hp version of the six-cylinder engine has been discontinued. F-Pace competitors include the BMW X3, Lexus NX, Lincoln Corsair, Porsche Macan and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nSelf-sealing tires are now standard on every F-Pace, while adaptive cruise control and Amazon Alexa are standard on all but the entry-level trim. A specially trimmed Edition 1988 version of the SVR gets a limited run of just 394 units.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jaguar F-Pace Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-speaker Meridian audio system\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nAmazon Alexa\nHead-up instrument display\nWi-Fi hot spot\n16-way power-adjustable front seats\nActive sports exhaust (SVR)\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jaguar F-Pace?\n\nThe Jaguar F-Pace certainly leans toward the sporty side of the SUV spectrum, which is ideal if your priorities include a well-balanced ride, sharp steering responses and a wide variety of engine choices. We think the base turbo four will be acceptable to most car shoppers, but the thunderous supercharged V-8 in the F-Pace SVR is an absolute riot — so long as you don’t mind its sky-high price or thirst for fuel.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi Q5, BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class\n\nLooks like: The 2020 F-Pace with some subtle tweaks (the significant changes are inside and under the hood)\n\nPowertrain: 246-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (F-Pace 250 and S 250); 335-hp, turbocharged and supercharged mild-hybrid 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (S 340); 395-hp, turbocharged and supercharged mild-hybrid 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (R-Dynamic S 400); eight-speed automatic transmission; standard all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: TBA, likely late 2021\n\nIn an SUV-mad world, it’s not surprising that Jaguar’s top-selling vehicle is the F-Pace, the British luxury brand’s largest SUV. We’ve been fans of the big cat’s handling and power, but felt the interior and technology were in need of an upgrade. Perhaps Jaguar heard our pleas: For the 2021 model year, the F-Pace is getting just that, along with some revised engine options and subtly updated exterior styling.\n\nRelated: 2019 Jaguar F-Pace SVR Review: Roaring Kitty\n\nThe 2021 F-Pace was announced with four trim levels to start: the 250 and S 250, the more powerful S 340 and the current top-of-the-line R Dynamic S 400. Notably absent from this announcement is an SVR version, which borrowed the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 and delightful exhaust note (in addition to other go-fast bits) from the F-Type R. It’s possible, even probable, that a new F-Pace SVR is coming further down the line, but for now, we’ll just have to make do with the 395-horsepower R-Dynamic S 400.\n\nExterior\n\nFrom the outside, the changes to the F-Pace for 2021 are subtle. The headlights are slimmer and feature Jaguar’s new signature “Double J Blade” lighting pattern. A redesigned front grille and bumper air intakes along with a more sculpted hood give the F-Pace a more menacing look from the front.\n\nIn back, new taillights use the “chicane” pattern Jaguar debuted on the all-electric I-Pace. Jaguar redesigned the rear bumper, as well, to further enhance the SUV’s sporty appearance.\n\nInterior\n\nMuch bigger changes happen inside the F-Pace. All 2021 F-Paces will come standard with heated seats, keyless entry and a 14-speaker Meridian stereo. Occupant comfort is a foremost consideration, with a new seat design that has wider cushioning as well as larger heating and cooling areas, plus enhanced massage functions. Jaguar also says it used more soft-touch materials in the cabin. Premium upholstery and accent materials abound, as befits a luxury car. A first for Jaguar, active road-noise cancellation is available on the F-Pace, as is a cabin air ionizer for those looking for improved cabin air quality.\n\nThe infotainment system also receives a significant upgrade, featuring the new Pivi Pro software that allows for over-the-air updates in an 11.4 inch curved-glass display that Jaguar says is three times brighter and almost 50% larger than the previous F-Pace’s 10-inch display. According to Jaguar, frequently used functions are available “in two taps or less,” and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard across the F-Pace lineup. A fully digital 12.3-inch instrument panel with full-screen 3D navigation is optional.\n\nOther interior updates include a redesigned gear selector lever featuring “cricket-ball” stitching … which is probably useful if you’d like to practice a variety of bowling grips. (Do cricket bowlers use different grips? I grew up playing baseball, so I’m impressed with myself that I even knew they’re called bowlers.)\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nMissing from the 2021 F-Pace’s engine lineup is one four-cylinder engine choice as well as the previously mentioned SVR’s supercharged V-8. While it seems likely the SVR will be announced separately, it also seems likely that the more powerful four-cylinder is gone in the name of lineup simplification.\n\nFor now, buyers can choose a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 246 hp, a carryover from previous model years available in the F-Pace 250 and S 250, or two new turbocharged and supercharged mild-hybrid 3.0-liter six-cylinders. The first makes 335 hp and powers the S 340, while the second makes 395 hp under the hood of the R-Dynamic S 400. Both use an integrated electric generator and 48-volt lithium-ion battery pack to provide a jolt of extra power and improve the engine stop-start operation.\n\nAll 2021 F-Paces are equipped with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. JaguarDrive Control includes four selectable drive modes: Comfort, Eco, Rain-Ice-Snow and Dynamic, which adjust steering, transmission and throttle response. Also new for the F-Pace is Auto Vehicle Hold, which keeps the SUV stationary until the driver presses on the accelerator.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety features include blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and a 3D surround-view camera system. Other advanced safety features are optional, including what Jaguar calls Clear Exit Monitor, which can alert occupants of an approaching vehicle or bicycle when attempting to open a door.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nBoth when it’s coming and what it’ll cost are unknown at this time, though it’s a safe bet that the former answer will be “sometime late this year” and the latter will be “more.”\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If Jaguar wanted to build an SUV, it’s bizarre — from a financial standpoint, anyway — that it wouldn’t just sculpt and rebadge an SUV from Land Rover, its sister brand that builds many acclaimed SUVs. (India’s Tata Motors owns both British marques.) Yet Jaguar insists it never even considered making a version of the Range Rover Sport or Evoque because the whole gamut of Land Rovers is simply incapable of driving like a Jag.\n\nAs billed, the F-Pace does, in fact, drive like a Jaguar. Developed on the same platform as the all-new XE and redesigned XF, it’s as fun to drive as you’d expect from a brand known for roadsters and sport sedans, but electronic glitches with our test car raise concerns.\n\nOn sale now, the F-Pace slots between compact and midsize rivals (think BMW X3 and X5 or Mercedes-Benz GLC- and GLE-Class) in overall length, with a price that puts it closer to the smaller set. All-wheel drive is standard and the F-Pace comes in six trim levels, with a supercharged, 3.0-liter V-6 that makes either 340 horsepower or, in the top two trims, 380 hp. Go here to stack them all up.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n\nWith Jaguar’s squinting headlights, tall grille and signature taillights, the F-Pace fits right in with the rest of the lineup. Lineage aside, it has all the cues of a performance SUV: high belt line, long hood, short overhangs and wide stance.\n\nNaturally, that profile robs visibility. Forward sight lines are acceptable, but the belt line and roofline converge on a small rear window that limits the rearward view even if you flip the rear head restraints down.\n\nA panoramic moonroof is standard, as are 18-inch alloy wheels. Top trim levels have some light ground effects and you can option the wheels all the way up to 22-inchers.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nThe F-Pace’s supercharged V-6 pulls the SUV swiftly up to speed, with just a hint of coarseness if you push it all the way toward redline. I drove both versions of the V-6 and the extra 40 hp — a tuning modification, Jaguar says, with no difference in torque — is hard to detect. Both versions deliver punchy acceleration, making Jaguar’s zero-to-60-mph claims of 5.1 to 5.4 seconds, depending on engine, entirely believable. Those numbers are sport-sedan quick and impressive for a base gasoline engine.\n\nThe accelerator responds immediately, enabling lag-free movement from a standstill — an unsung benefit in many Jaguars, especially considering the lag that’s rampant in too many luxury cars. Still, the F-Pace’s eight-speed automatic occasionally hunts on downshifts. Driver-selectable sport modes quell some of this, but transmissions should be responsive without the driver having to futz with settings.\n\nRide quality is firm but livable, with limited body motion over rapid elevation changes. The suspension neutralizes individual bumps well enough, but broken pavement brings a busy sensation that can wear on you. I drove cars with both the fixed suspension and an adaptive option and didn’t detect a huge difference between the two.\n\nFor the average luxury SUV shopper, the F-Pace’s handling should satisfy. The SUV delivers secure grip, flat cornering and direct enough steering. Its significant width, however — at 81.5 inches, it’s about 5 inches wider than an X5 — will keep you from wanting to sling it around tight corners. The brakes require an inch or two of pedal travel before much response, but they’re strong thereafter.\n\nLater this year, Jaguar will debut a base, turbocharged diesel four-cylinder good for 180 hp and 318 pounds-feet of torque. EPA-estimated mileage for the gasoline F-Pace is 18/23/20 mpg city/highway/combined. Estimates are still pending for the diesel version.\n\nInterior\n\n\nThe cabin sweeps around in a traditional cockpit orientation, but it’s wide enough to avoid feeling pinched. Jaguar also left some well-placed storage areas to hold a smartphone or two. Cabin materials show some cost-cutting below arm and elbow level — areas where the GLC-Class excels — but they’re nicer elsewhere, with an optional vinyl-wrapped dashboard that could pass for real cowhide.\n\nI can’t say the same for the F-Pace’s Luxtec vinyl upholstery, which is standard in lower trims (the norm in this class). It’s a rubbery, cheap-feeling substitute for the real leather that comes in higher trims. (Not all vinyl upholstery feels this way; it’s a convincing alternative in some luxury cars.) Power-adjustable front seats are standard; sport seats with deeper bolsters are optional, as are heated and ventilated seats.\n\nThe three-position backseat has good headroom and legroom but a rather low seat height; some adults may find their knees uncomfortably elevated. Heated outboard seats with power recliners are optional, but all rear passengers will be annoyed in the F-Pace’s lower trims, which lack a center armrest or any rear cupholders. C’mon, Jaguar. Let the masses have their Big Gulps.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n\nThe F-Pace has a standard Meridian stereo with HD radio, USB and iPod compatibility, and Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio streaming. It’s easy to use thanks to physical shortcut keys that flank the standard 8-inch touch-screen. There’s also a 5-inch display between the analog gauges.\n\nAn optional multimedia system adds upgraded Meridian audio and swaps the gauges for a 12.3-inch virtual instrument cluster. The screen can simulate various gauge themes or show a navigation map, similar to Audi’s virtual cockpit (though the Jaguar display lacks Audi’s Google Earth overlays, if you’re into that). It also trades the 8-inch dashboard touch-screen for a 10.2-inch unit that eliminates the shortcut keys. I prefer the mechanical keys to the larger display’s onscreen ones, but the system is otherwise an upgrade — especially its navigation system, with pinch and swipe capabilities that work at smartphone speed. You can still get navigation with the 8-inch display, but it’s a slow, yesteryear system by comparison.\n\nJaguar says its dedicated InControl Apps interface — also optional — integrates third-party apps from a connected iPhone or Android smartphone. Still, the F-Pace doesn’t offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, two interfaces fast becoming the price of entry for any multimedia system.\n\nAn optional waterproof wristband transponder, which Jaguar calls Activity Key, gets you into or out of your car without the normal remote. The embedded RFID tag means it’s battery-free and, as part of the locking process, deactivates any remotes you leave inside the car while you surf, swim or whatever. Way cool, brah.\n\nConcerning, however, are the F-Pace’s electronics, which had all kinds of glitches during our two weeks in a local test car after returning from Jaguar’s media drive.\n\nMultiple editors noted the bugaboos. In two instances, the volume and channel-surfing controls froze on satellite radio. The audio also cut out entirely, once with FM radio and another time with satellite. Both outages occurred in areas without apparent signal obstructions. In several cases the backup camera failed to engage with the F-Pace in Reverse, and in one instance we observed a warning light appear for the automatic emergency braking system while we were stopped at an intersection.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe F-Pace’s cargo area has 33.5 cubic feet of space below window level, which is impressive for the class. The backseat folds in a 40/20/40 split to provide 63.5 cubic feet of maximum cargo room. A power liftgate is standard; hands-free operation is optional.\n\nSafety\n\nThe F-Pace has not been crash-tested. Jaguar offers the usual panoply of safety tech, but much of it is optional instead of standard. Base models lack a backup camera, which is inexcusable for a 2017 luxury SUV. Optional forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking doesn’t come in the bottom three trim levels, which make up more than half of all F-Pace inventory on Cars.com. In the GLC-Class, collision warning with automatic braking is standard.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nIt’s certainly not the first time we’ve experienced glitches in a Jaguar (our recent experience in an XJ sedan was similar) and it raises questions of long-term reliability. But Jaguar mitigates that to a great extent with its impressive warranty and maintenance coverage.\n\nJaguar struck while the iron was hot, launching its first SUV as consumer demand for the body style soared. The smithy served up some fine metal indeed with the F-Pace, which starts at a little over $43,000 with destination. The diesel version will reduce that by about $1,400 when it goes on sale.\n\nSomewhere between the F-Pace’s starting price and its high $70,000s ceiling, the SUV should appeal to any performance-SUV shopper. There’s no doubt the brand will cannibalize a few of them from its Land Rover sibling, but the F-Pace should get a piece of the luxury SUV pie nonetheless — much of it from other competitors.\n\nEditor’s note: This review was updated Oct. 1, 2016, to detail glitches observed in an F-Pace driven after the media preview.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Incredibly quick, undeniably stylish and bursting with in-your-face attitude, the Jaguar F-Pace SVR is an expensive luxury all-weather rocket.\n\nVersus the competition: Aiming squarely for the Alfa Romeo Stelvio , the F-Pace SVR presents a compelling alternative with slightly more room, equally attractive styling and performance that’s a match for the Italian stallion.\n\nI still don’t quite understand the concept of a high-performance SUV. The Jaguar F-Pace SVR is a maniacal vehicle — a blisteringly quick, rorty-snorty, V-8-powered monster that’s ridiculous fun to drive. But it’s also loaded with track-focused systems — and who takes an SUV to a racetrack? SUVs are the vehicles you use to tow your car to a track day, not the vehicles you use on the circuit.\n\nYet the luxury market includes people who want the best, fastest, most outrageous vehicles automakers can produce, cost be damned, and there’s no shortage of such models. The Mercedes-AMG GLC63, Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, Audi SQ5, BMW X3 M and Jaguar F-Pace SVR are all members of this expensive, exclusive group.\n\nLike the others, the Jag excels in this role, with a massive, boosted V-8, huge wheels and tires, an adaptive suspension, and a formidable price tag.\n\nThat Sexy Feline Look\n\nYou’ll either think the latest F-Pace looks svelte and sexy or tepid and anonymous. I tend to think it looks good, with clean lines and feline styling accents that emphasize its heritage without being too throwback or retro.\n\nThe SVR amps up the sporty parts of the F-Pace’s styling, with unique front and rear bumpers, side sills and a more aggressive spoiler — all of which are actually functional, Jaguar says, helping to improve cooling, aerodynamics and high-speed stability. The base F-Pace doesn’t suffer from drab styling, but the SVR improvements make a good thing even better. On our test vehicle, the look was made even better by the optional 22-inch wheels and eye-popping Ultra Blue paint.\n\nThere’s no shortage of options for expensive, high-performance SUVs.\n\nCompetitors feature equally appealing styling, particularly the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, which has even sexier bodywork and equally screaming performance. If you want something German, BMW offers an X3 M for 2020, and Mercedes-AMG has the GLC63. Want something even bigger and more brutish? The Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk is ready to stomp the Europeans into the asphalt.\n\nBig Engine, Big Noise, Big Fun\n\nPowering the F-Pace SVR is Jaguar’s excellent supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 making 550 horsepower and 502 pounds-feet of torque. It’s as glorious here as it is in other Jaguar products, including the F-Type SVR coupe and convertible. The sound it makes is one of the greatest sounds in automotivedom: It is simply fantastic from startup to wide-open throttle, delivering incredible speed and aural satisfaction that the latest crop of electric cars simply can’t match.\n\nThe Jag’s supercharger means the engine is instantly responsive; there’s none of the lag you might experience in a turbocharged competitor, though you might miss some of the blow-off valve whoosh that accompanies those motors. If the exhaust isn’t quite loud enough for you, there’s a button on the console that opens up the pipes a bit more, allowing you to scare other drivers in tunnels or parking garages. It introduces a back pressure popping that makes you feel like you truly are driving a track car. The powertrain isn’t quite as frenetic as the Alfa Romeo Stelvio’s turbocharged V-6, but it feels more responsive than the twin-turbo V-8 in the latest Mercedes-AMG GLC63, likely due to its more aggressive transmission tuning.\n\nHandling is also a highlight thanks to an electronically adjustable suspension and firm, direct steering. The trade-off is a stiff ride even in the most comfortable setting, and it wasn’t helped by the optional 22-inch wheels in my tester. That’s almost to be expected, however, when purchasing a high-performance machine like this. By comparison, the latest adjustable suspension in the GLC63 affords more composed, less abusive ride quality.\n\nI wish Jaguar allowed you to adjust various systems — powertrain, suspension and other parameters — independently, as BMW does, to create your own setting. Instead, Jaguar limits you to just its preset adjustments. That said, the overall experience is definitely enjoyable. The Jag feels quick and nimble, and it exhibits amazing body control. Still, it’s not something you’d necessarily want to take on a track; it has a high seating position and center of gravity, so while it might be fun and racy on the street, it wouldn’t be my first choice for a weekend amateur track event. It’s also not something you’d want to drive cross-country, as that stiff suspension will induce fatigue over longer voyages.\n\nFuel economy isn’t a big concern in a vehicle like this, but we’ll touch on it briefly. The SVR is EPA-rated 16/21/18 mpg city/highway/combined, which is about average for this level of performance in a small SUV. The 2019 Mercedes-AMG GLC63, with its smaller, twin-turbocharged V-8 and an extra cog in its nine-speed automatic transmission, comes in just barely higher, at 16/22/18 mpg. The twin-turbocharged V-6 in the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio only marginally helps it at the pump, with a 17/23/19 mpg rating, while the new 2020 BMW X3 M and its turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six rings in surprisingly low even in this class, at 14/19/16 mpg.\n\nNice Inside, But Not the Nicest\n\nAt this price, the interior had better wow the buyer, and the Jaguar comes close. Taken by itself, the inside is impressively outfitted, with well-appointed materials, a clean design and comfortable seats. But it falls about mid-pack in terms of luxuriousness, ahead of the needs-improvement Stelvio but behind the latest, greatest GLC63. Materials quality is there, with excellent leather on the dash, door surfaces and seats, but the design is dated and many of the controls and multimedia screens need freshening.\n\nComfort isn’t a problem, certainly, despite the fact that the cabin feels tight, especially in back. Tight backseats are another common feature of this category, and at least the Jaguar’s is usable — more than I can say for the Alfa. Front-seat comfort is excellent, with big, bolstered sport seats featuring lovely quilted leather and lots of adjustability. Visibility out the Jag is also excellent thanks to an upright seating position and decently big windows. There’s no sacrifice of function to form here; the Jaguar looks good and allows you to see out easily. But then, so do many of its competitors, so this aspect is something of a wash.\n\nThe multimedia system is Jaguar’s 10-inch Touch Pro system, and as in every other Jaguar Land Rover I’ve tried it in, it was somewhat problematic in the F-Pace. Its biggest issue is a lack of any sort of feedback, either audible or haptic, to let you know you’ve successfully selected whatever you were trying to select. The system also has perceptible lag when switching between screens, but at least the angle of the screen doesn’t reflect the sky as it does in several other Land Rovers I’ve tried. And you can’t fault the audio system: The optional 380-watt Meridian premium audio is outstanding and highly adjustable, so you can make your music sound however you want it to.\n\nCargo room is surprisingly good. Jaguar claims more space behind the second row than most of its competitors, saying the F-Pace SVR has 33.5 cubic feet. But the marque doesn’t give numbers for total volume with the second row stowed (even though those seats do fold, just like the rest of the competition). By comparison, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio has a relatively small cargo area, just 18.5 cubic feet, while the Mercedes-AMG GLC isn’t much better, at 19.4 cubic feet. The BMW X3 is slightly more comparable, chiming in at 28.7 cubic feet of cargo area. The F-Pace’s cargo area feels like a big, usable space, so unlike some of the smaller SUV “coupes” you see from German automakers, you’ll get all the style of the Jag plus usable space for people and their stuff.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Jaguar F-Pace has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which isn’t unusual for a luxury car sold in lower volumes. It has a fair amount of standard safety equipment, which is typical for its class: low-speed forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and a driver condition monitor all come standard on your F-Pace. If you want the full gamut of protection, however, you’ll have to add the Driver Assist Package, which includes a blind spot monitor, 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control with steering assist, high-speed automatic emergency braking, automatic park assist and a rear cross-traffic monitor. That package will run you a not insignificant $3,600.\n\nExclusivity at a Price\n\nStarting price for a 2019 F-Pace SVR is $81,015 including destination fee, but with the options on my well-equipped test vehicle, the price came to a lofty $89,900. You can certainly get less expensive versions of the F-Pace: The base model starts at a far more reasonable $45,825, and there are a variety of versions between the two, featuring two turbocharged four-cylinder engines and a supercharged V-6 in addition to the supercharged V-8 in the SVR.\n\nLest you think that’s too much money for a high-performance SUV, know that the F-Pace’s competitors are priced very similarly. A 2019 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio is within a few bucks of the Jag, with a starting price of $81,840. The German competitors come in a little less to start but quickly approach our as-tested price once you add options. A 2020 BMW X3 M starts at $70,895 and the 2019 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 rings in at $71,795, but adding some basic necessities, like safety systems and premium audio, brings those prices up to competitive levels.\n\nIf you’re on board with the idea of a high-performance SUV — maybe because you can’t have a sedan anymore given there are kids in the picture, or maybe because you’re out to get the most expensive, most outrageous SUV you can somewhat afford (as many luxury dealers tell us is the case when certain customers walk into a showroom) — the Jag will deliver plenty of entertaining miles in rapid fashion. It’s rare enough that you won’t see one on every corner, and Jaguar has done an admirable job differentiating it inside and out from the base versions that cost half as much as the SVR. It’s a crowded field, however, so it makes sense to shop the competition, as well.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Incredibly quick, undeniably stylish and bursting with in-your-face attitude, the Jaguar F-Pace SVR is an expensive luxury all-weather rocket.\n\nVersus the competition: Aiming squarely for the Alfa Romeo Stelvio , the F-Pace SVR presents a compelling alternative with slightly more room, equally attractive styling and performance that’s a match for the Italian stallion.\n\nI still don’t quite understand the concept of a high-performance SUV. The Jaguar F-Pace SVR is a maniacal vehicle — a blisteringly quick, rorty-snorty, V-8-powered monster that’s ridiculous fun to drive. But it’s also loaded with track-focused systems — and who takes an SUV to a racetrack? SUVs are the vehicles you use to tow your car to a track day, not the vehicles you use on the circuit.\n\nYet the luxury market includes people who want the best, fastest, most outrageous vehicles automakers can produce, cost be damned, and there’s no shortage of such models. The Mercedes-AMG GLC63, Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, Audi SQ5, BMW X3 M and Jaguar F-Pace SVR are all members of this expensive, exclusive group.\n\nLike the others, the Jag excels in this role, with a massive, boosted V-8, huge wheels and tires, an adaptive suspension, and a formidable price tag.\n\nThat Sexy Feline Look\n\nYou’ll either think the latest F-Pace looks svelte and sexy or tepid and anonymous. I tend to think it looks good, with clean lines and feline styling accents that emphasize its heritage without being too throwback or retro.\n\nThe SVR amps up the sporty parts of the F-Pace’s styling, with unique front and rear bumpers, side sills and a more aggressive spoiler — all of which are actually functional, Jaguar says, helping to improve cooling, aerodynamics and high-speed stability. The base F-Pace doesn’t suffer from drab styling, but the SVR improvements make a good thing even better. On our test vehicle, the look was made even better by the optional 22-inch wheels and eye-popping Ultra Blue paint.\n\nThere’s no shortage of options for expensive, high-performance SUVs.\n\nCompetitors feature equally appealing styling, particularly the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, which has even sexier bodywork and equally screaming performance. If you want something German, BMW offers an X3 M for 2020, and Mercedes-AMG has the GLC63. Want something even bigger and more brutish? The Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk is ready to stomp the Europeans into the asphalt.\n\nBig Engine, Big Noise, Big Fun\n\nPowering the F-Pace SVR is Jaguar’s excellent supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 making 550 horsepower and 502 pounds-feet of torque. It’s as glorious here as it is in other Jaguar products, including the F-Type SVR coupe and convertible. The sound it makes is one of the greatest sounds in automotivedom: It is simply fantastic from startup to wide-open throttle, delivering incredible speed and aural satisfaction that the latest crop of electric cars simply can’t match.\n\nThe Jag’s supercharger means the engine is instantly responsive; there’s none of the lag you might experience in a turbocharged competitor, though you might miss some of the blow-off valve whoosh that accompanies those motors. If the exhaust isn’t quite loud enough for you, there’s a button on the console that opens up the pipes a bit more, allowing you to scare other drivers in tunnels or parking garages. It introduces a back pressure popping that makes you feel like you truly are driving a track car. The powertrain isn’t quite as frenetic as the Alfa Romeo Stelvio’s turbocharged V-6, but it feels more responsive than the twin-turbo V-8 in the latest Mercedes-AMG GLC63, likely due to its more aggressive transmission tuning.\n\nHandling is also a highlight thanks to an electronically adjustable suspension and firm, direct steering. The trade-off is a stiff ride even in the most comfortable setting, and it wasn’t helped by the optional 22-inch wheels in my tester. That’s almost to be expected, however, when purchasing a high-performance machine like this. By comparison, the latest adjustable suspension in the GLC63 affords more composed, less abusive ride quality.\n\nI wish Jaguar allowed you to adjust various systems — powertrain, suspension and other parameters — independently, as BMW does, to create your own setting. Instead, Jaguar limits you to just its preset adjustments. That said, the overall experience is definitely enjoyable. The Jag feels quick and nimble, and it exhibits amazing body control. Still, it’s not something you’d necessarily want to take on a track; it has a high seating position and center of gravity, so while it might be fun and racy on the street, it wouldn’t be my first choice for a weekend amateur track event. It’s also not something you’d want to drive cross-country, as that stiff suspension will induce fatigue over longer voyages.\n\nFuel economy isn’t a big concern in a vehicle like this, but we’ll touch on it briefly. The SVR is EPA-rated 16/21/18 mpg city/highway/combined, which is about average for this level of performance in a small SUV. The 2019 Mercedes-AMG GLC63, with its smaller, twin-turbocharged V-8 and an extra cog in its nine-speed automatic transmission, comes in just barely higher, at 16/22/18 mpg. The twin-turbocharged V-6 in the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio only marginally helps it at the pump, with a 17/23/19 mpg rating, while the new 2020 BMW X3 M and its turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six rings in surprisingly low even in this class, at 14/19/16 mpg.\n\nNice Inside, But Not the Nicest\n\nAt this price, the interior had better wow the buyer, and the Jaguar comes close. Taken by itself, the inside is impressively outfitted, with well-appointed materials, a clean design and comfortable seats. But it falls about mid-pack in terms of luxuriousness, ahead of the needs-improvement Stelvio but behind the latest, greatest GLC63. Materials quality is there, with excellent leather on the dash, door surfaces and seats, but the design is dated and many of the controls and multimedia screens need freshening.\n\nComfort isn’t a problem, certainly, despite the fact that the cabin feels tight, especially in back. Tight backseats are another common feature of this category, and at least the Jaguar’s is usable — more than I can say for the Alfa. Front-seat comfort is excellent, with big, bolstered sport seats featuring lovely quilted leather and lots of adjustability. Visibility out the Jag is also excellent thanks to an upright seating position and decently big windows. There’s no sacrifice of function to form here; the Jaguar looks good and allows you to see out easily. But then, so do many of its competitors, so this aspect is something of a wash.\n\nThe multimedia system is Jaguar’s 10-inch Touch Pro system, and as in every other Jaguar Land Rover I’ve tried it in, it was somewhat problematic in the F-Pace. Its biggest issue is a lack of any sort of feedback, either audible or haptic, to let you know you’ve successfully selected whatever you were trying to select. The system also has perceptible lag when switching between screens, but at least the angle of the screen doesn’t reflect the sky as it does in several other Land Rovers I’ve tried. And you can’t fault the audio system: The optional 380-watt Meridian premium audio is outstanding and highly adjustable, so you can make your music sound however you want it to.\n\nCargo room is surprisingly good. Jaguar claims more space behind the second row than most of its competitors, saying the F-Pace SVR has 33.5 cubic feet. But the marque doesn’t give numbers for total volume with the second row stowed (even though those seats do fold, just like the rest of the competition). By comparison, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio has a relatively small cargo area, just 18.5 cubic feet, while the Mercedes-AMG GLC isn’t much better, at 19.4 cubic feet. The BMW X3 is slightly more comparable, chiming in at 28.7 cubic feet of cargo area. The F-Pace’s cargo area feels like a big, usable space, so unlike some of the smaller SUV “coupes” you see from German automakers, you’ll get all the style of the Jag plus usable space for people and their stuff.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Jaguar F-Pace has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which isn’t unusual for a luxury car sold in lower volumes. It has a fair amount of standard safety equipment, which is typical for its class: low-speed forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and a driver condition monitor all come standard on your F-Pace. If you want the full gamut of protection, however, you’ll have to add the Driver Assist Package, which includes a blind spot monitor, 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control with steering assist, high-speed automatic emergency braking, automatic park assist and a rear cross-traffic monitor. That package will run you a not insignificant $3,600.\n\nExclusivity at a Price\n\nStarting price for a 2019 F-Pace SVR is $81,015 including destination fee, but with the options on my well-equipped test vehicle, the price came to a lofty $89,900. You can certainly get less expensive versions of the F-Pace: The base model starts at a far more reasonable $45,825, and there are a variety of versions between the two, featuring two turbocharged four-cylinder engines and a supercharged V-6 in addition to the supercharged V-8 in the SVR.\n\nLest you think that’s too much money for a high-performance SUV, know that the F-Pace’s competitors are priced very similarly. A 2019 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio is within a few bucks of the Jag, with a starting price of $81,840. The German competitors come in a little less to start but quickly approach our as-tested price once you add options. A 2020 BMW X3 M starts at $70,895 and the 2019 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 rings in at $71,795, but adding some basic necessities, like safety systems and premium audio, brings those prices up to competitive levels.\n\nIf you’re on board with the idea of a high-performance SUV — maybe because you can’t have a sedan anymore given there are kids in the picture, or maybe because you’re out to get the most expensive, most outrageous SUV you can somewhat afford (as many luxury dealers tell us is the case when certain customers walk into a showroom) — the Jag will deliver plenty of entertaining miles in rapid fashion. It’s rare enough that you won’t see one on every corner, and Jaguar has done an admirable job differentiating it inside and out from the base versions that cost half as much as the SVR. It’s a crowded field, however, so it makes sense to shop the competition, as well.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: New performance SVR model with 550 horsepower. All models add standard emergency braking, lane keep assist, driver condition monitor, backup camera, and front and rear parking aids. An infotainment system with a 10-inch screen is standard on all trim levels, and one engine — the 340-horsepower V-6 for the 35t — has been dropped.\n\nPrice change: With the 35t no longer in the lineup, trim levels for remaining engines are pricier, rising from $1,000 to $2,535. The $995 destination charge is unchanged.\n\nOn sale: Late summer\n\nWhich should you buy, 2018 or 2019? Buy the 2018 if you’re looking to save some cash. All 2019 variants have more standard features but higher base prices.\n\nJaguar boosts the performance credibility of its F-Pace SUV for 2019 with the addition of the SVR, a new top-of-the-line model with a 550-horsepower, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine, standard adaptive suspension and 21-inch wheels (22-inchers are optional). The SVR starts at $80,985 including destination.\n\nRelated: 2019 Jaguar F-Pace SVR: One Ferocious Feline\n\nElsewhere in the F-Pace lineup, all models now have standard automatic emergency braking, lane departure steering assist, a driver condition monitor, a backup camera, and front and rear parking aids, some or all of which were optional last year. True lane-centering steering, previously unavailable, is now optional.\n\nAll trim levels also have a standard InControl Touch Pro infotainment system with a 10-inch screen, which supplants last year’s standard 8-inch screen. The F-Pace still does not come with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, though some smartphone apps can work with the InControl system.\n\nJaguar isn’t giving away all this stuff, however. Base prices are up $2,535, so the F-Pace now starts at $45,595 including destination. The luxury brand also trimmed the lineup by deleting 35t models, which used a supercharged 340-hp, 3.0-liter V-6. The lone V-6 model for 2019 is the S, which returns with a 380-hp version of the 3.0-liter.\n\nAlso returning are a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline four-cylinder with 247 or 296 hp, depending on model, and a turbo 2.0-liter diesel four-cylinder with 180 hp. All models have an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive that operates in rear drive on dry roads and automatically transfers power to the front wheels as needed in slippery conditions.\n\nThe F-Pace offers a choice of four engines and capable performance in a stylish package that seats up to five with ample cargo room.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
