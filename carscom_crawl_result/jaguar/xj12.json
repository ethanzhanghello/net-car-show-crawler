      "expert_review": "The big cat from Great Britain’s Jaguar Cars Ltd., has grown up a little for 1996.\n\nThe new models, the Vanden Plas and the XJ12, are the longest Jaguars ever manufactured, possessing size and wheelbase dimensions carried by full-size American luxury automobiles.\n\n“We’ve had a great deal of interest in the Vanden Plas because of its increased size,” said Scott Fischer of Tom Wood Jaguar. “Our customers have been tremendously impressed by the increased room and luxury.”\n\nWhether Jaguar’s being owned by the Ford Motor Co. had anything to do with it is a matter of conjecture, but the Vanden Plas’s and XJ12’s 117.9-inch wheelbase is comparable to the Lincoln Town Car at 117.4 inches. And at 202.8 inches of overall length, the Jag is in the ballpark of the Lincoln Continental’s 206.3 inches.\n\nIn the realm of British automobiles, these are big motor cars. They also are high-dollar ones, with the V-12 cylinder-powered XJ12 priced at $79,370. The Vanden Plas starts at $64,420, the third-most expensive model of a lineup that also includes the XJ6 ($56,320), the XJR ($66,279), and the XJS convertible ($61,570).\n\nThe Vanden Plas and XJ12 obviously are not designed to appeal to the economy car buyer, but rather to those who need more back seat room for friends, family, or corporate associates.\n\nBlame it on the ’93\n\nThe concept sprung from the 1993 Jaguar Majestic sedan, a model not offered on the American market. This was a limited production, semi-custom car, with much of its body work done by an outside supplier.\n\nThe acceptance of the Majestic prompted the decision to build the longer-wheelbase Vanden Plas and XK12, the only way these models are offered.\n\nOnce the project was given the green light, it took just 15 months to bring the cars to market.\n\nJaguar also took the opportunity to do some upgrading. The rear sound deadening was improved by filling voids with foam. Other improvements included thicker door glass and longer rear springs to enhance the ride.\n\nThe entire job added only 50 more pounds of weight, and Jaguar states that the longer cars are just as rigid as the shorter 113-inch wheelbase XJ6.\n\nThe body and wheelbase lengthening job creates a quantum leap forward in rear-seat leg room, providing an additional 4.5 inches. Modifying the roof has provided an extra half-inch of headroom front and back. If an owner is of Indiana Pacer player dimensions, the sunroof can be deleted, adding yet another inch of headroom.\n\nThere are some other touches connected to the new construction, such as longer rear doors, which provide significantly improved access to the back seat. Then, there is an item that all luxury car makers would do well to examine.\n\nAn electric switch allows rear passengers to adjust the position of the front passenger seat. (Assuming, of course, that the front-seat occupant doesn’t object.) The control switches are located on the inboard side of the front passenger seat back.\n\nIt almost goes without saying that the tradit ional Jaguar amenities are included in the long-wheelbase sedans. Natural grain, premium Autolux leather is included, as are matched wood inlays and matching wooden shift knobs. Both cars have a full line of power accessories and comfort and convenience accessories.\n\nWhat the cars do not share is the same engine.\n\nThe Vanden Plas is powered by Jaguar’s double overhead cam, 24-valve in-line 6, while the XJ12 is named after its single overhead cam (per head) V-12 engine. The XJ12 is one of but a handful of cars made today offering a 12-cylinder engine.\n\n“The 12 is a very specialized type of car,” Fischer said. “It mainly interests someone who wants that particular type of engine.”\n\nAt 366 cubic inches (6.0 liters), it has power to spare at 313 horsepower and 353 foot-pounds of torque. By comparison, the in- line six is rated at 245 horsepower and 289 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe V-12, however, is incredibly smooth and performs yeoman duties as the epitome of a continental to uring en gine.",

      "expert_review": "All of a sudden, the future is starting to look mighty bright for Jaguar.\n\nPummeled by Lexus and Infiniti and battered by the recession, sales of the British-made luxury cars had dropped by 50 percent since the mid-’80s.\n\nWhen word got out that Jaguar owners ranked their cars among the world’s best, sales started climbing again. That happened in December, when a survey conducted by J.D. Powers and Associates showed Jaguar was in the top 10 in customer satisfaction.\n\nThat survey was no fluke. Much has changed for Jaguar in the last two years. Quality has vastly improved. Safety features such as air bags and anti-lock brakes have been added. And for 1993, Jaguar is offering two very special high performance cars. One is the limited production XJR-S. The other is this week’s test car, the XJ12 luxury sports sedan, which features a race-bred V-12.\n\nThe XJ12, which is arriving at Jaguar dealerships as a 1994 model, is the first 12-cylinder sedan Jaguar has made for the United States since 1979.\n\nIn recent years, buyers of luxury sedans who also wanted high performance had to turn to BMW, Infiniti or Mercedes-Benz because Jaguar only offered a six-cylinder engine. The others offered high-tech 32-valve quad-cam V-8s.\n\nThe addition of the XJ12 – at a price the Germans can’t match and with a level of style the Japanese can’t equal – makes Jaguar a force to be reckoned within the high performance luxury car market.\n\nOnce you drive the XJ12 and tap into its seemingly unlimited reserves of power and discover its capable and competent handling, you’ll lust after it. Few of today’s cars inspire that kind of passion.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nYou need just two words to describe the XJ12’s performance: intense and immense. Zero-to-60 mph flashes by in under 7 seconds, according to Autocar & Motor, Britain’s biggest auto magazine. The British model has subtle differences, but it is basically the same as the American version of the car.\n\nAccording to Jaguar, the fuel-injected V-12 engine is rated at 301 horsepower. At idle, it’s not as smooth as a Lexus, Infiniti or Cadillac’s Northstar V-8. But it smooths out as soon as the tachometer needle rises above 900 rpm.\n\nThe wonderful sound of British machinery is one of the things that has lured luxury car buyers to Jaguars. The XJ12 makes all the right noises. If you drive the car aggressively, you’ll hear a nice turbine like whine and muffled sounds of air being drawn through the engine as you rev it up.\n\nAlthough Ford bought Jaguar in 1989, there are parts in the XJ12 still made by General Motors, which has supplied parts to Jaguar for more than 20 years. The computer-controlled four-speed automatic transmission is one of them. No matter, because this transmission is an excellent gearbox that delivers smooth and well-timed shifts.\n\nI did not calculate the fuel mileage, but if you are concerned with fluctuations in the price of unleaded premium, perhap s something in the Hyundai line would be more suitable.\n\nYou don’t buy a car like this for fuel economy purposes.\n\nHANDLING\n\nFor Jaguar, it was no simple matter of bolting up its coveted V-12 engine to the standard XJ6 body. More than 140 inner body panels had to be redesigned to accommodate the 6.0-liter V-12.\n\nIn the process, Jaguar engineers added a new rack and pinion steering system made by ZF of Germany. Though very tight and responsive, the steering wheel is so easy to turn that the XJ12 can be steered with one finger. A little more weight here would greatly improve the car’s over-the-road feel.\n\nThe four-wheel, power-assisted antilock disc brakes, however, are fast-acting and strong.\n\nLike the six-cylinder version, the XJ12 sports a firm four-wheel independent suspension system.\n\nI don’t believe the XJ12 is the best handling V-12 sedan available – it’s outclassed by BMW’s 750iL – but the average driver likely never will push the Jaguar hard enough to find its shortcomings.\n\nIf you accelerate quickly and turn sharply- not an ordinary maneuver – the XJ12 can lose its poise. The same thing can happen if you brake hard and turn sharply, such as you might to avoid an accident. A BMW 750iL, by comparison, simply will take such abuse in stride and with such finesse you would never know you were asking the car to perform extraordinarily.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nNot much has changed here. The XJ12 is outfitted almost exactly the same way as the Jaguar’s top-of-the-line six-cylinder Vanden Plas sedan.\n\nWith the XJ12, you’ll get Jaguar’s full luxury treatment. That includes Jaguar’s most luxurious wood and leather, plus fold-out picnic tables attached to the backs of the bucket seats.\n\nThe XJ12 offers a full array of power accessories, but as in the Vanden Plas, some of the switches and buttons – such as the ones for the seat adjustment and car’s computer – are in awkward places.\n\nI noticed the air conditioner worked better in the car than in any previous Jaguar I have driven. In other Jags, the air conditioner cooled the car just enough to keep you from complaining. But in the test car, the air conditioner felt strong enough to form icicles on the ceiling.\n\nI looked under the hood and noticed Jaguar has finally installed some modern air-conditioning equipment. On previous V-12s, the air conditioner’s compressor was the old, huge unit GM quit using in its own cars more than a decade ago.\n\nBack in the early ’70s when Jaguar was developing the V-12, someone at Jaguar apparently plucked one of these inefficient old contraptions out of a 1972 Buick Riviera and ran with it.\n\nIf you are interested in a V-12 sedan, here are you choices: BMW’s 750iL, which goes for about $80,000, and Mercedes-Benz’ 600SEL, priced at $129,000.\n\nBoth German cars are a bit larger than the Jaguar and have more in the way of technology. But they are also a bit stodgy.\n\nThe Jag is lithe,lean and agile. As for class, there is simply no comparison. Jaguar wins going away.\n\nTruett’s tip: The XJ12, with its powerful and lightweight V-12, offers tremendous performance, sports-sedan handling and classic British styling. The XJ12 is not as technically advanced as V-12sedans from Germany, but it sells for thousands of dollars less.",
