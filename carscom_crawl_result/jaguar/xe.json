      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the rest of our Luxury Sports Sedan Challenge field and, now, the Genesis G70\n\nLooks like: A 2019 Jaguar XE with subtle front and rear styling updates\n\nDrivetrain: Two turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines; eight-speed automatic transmission; P250 makes 247 horsepower, and P300 296 hp\n\nHits dealerships: Summer\n\nJaguar’s smallest sedan gets some subtle exterior updates for 2020 while dropping the optional diesel four-cylinder and 380-horsepower V-6 engines in North America, though global markets will still be able to purchase a diesel. It also adds some useful interior tech and some that we at Cars.com find … less desirable.\n\nRelated: 2019-2020 BMW 3 Series First Drive: Is the Mojo Back?\n\nThe saddest news is that the 380-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 in 2019 S models is dead. Our judges found the 240-hp turbo four in the 2017 XE that competed in our cross-class comparison a little underpowered despite the fun they were able to have with it in autocross testing. Will the current base engine’s 247 hp be enough? If not, you’ll only be able to upgrade to 296 hp. Inside, the XE gets the optional ClearSight Rear View Mirror that turns the rearview mirror into a display for a rear-facing camera. Also available is the InControl Touch Pro Duo dual-screen infotainment system, which we’re not huge fans of because of its lack of physical controls; instead it relies on touch-sensitive ones for most tasks.\n\nExterior\n\nThe exterior changes to the 2020 XE are pretty subtle: revised front and rear bumpers help the car look a bit wider and lower. Front bumper openings are wider, with S models having a horizontal bumper piece dividing side inlets while R-Dynamic models lack that divider for a truer sports sedan look. The grille is now wider and features a new mesh design. Redesigned LED taillights look similar to those on the all-electric I-Pace.\n\nInterior\n\nJaguar claims that “every aspect of the cabin has been enhanced for increased convenience, improved storage and better passenger comfort.” The interior certainly looks more modern, with ambient lighting adding a splash of color and boldness that was missing from the previous XE’s interior. It still appears somewhat cramped, retaining the high beltline, wide pillars and “bathtub” ledge below the front windows.\n\nWhile it looks modern, the optional InControl Touch Pro Duo drives us crazy with its touch-sensitive features — but at least that hasn’t extended to the steering wheel controls or window controls like it has in other Jaguar Land Rover models. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard. The rotary gear selector from previous models has been replaced by a more traditional-looking joystick-shaped SportShift selector first seen in the F-Type sports car.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nRegular S models have the P250 247-hp turbo four paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission delivering power to the rear wheels or through an optional all-wheel-drive system. R-Dynamic S models get the P300 engine, a 296-hp turbo four, and the same transmission with standard AWD. P300 models also get revised software programming and other upgraded internal components to provide improved throttle response and what should be a sportier driving experience.\n\nSafety\n\nThe ClearSight Rear View Mirror is an optional safety feature that allows the rearview mirror to turn into a video monitor and display an image from a rear-facing camera in the event that the traditional rear view is blocked. A driver alertness system, which monitors vehicle and driver behavior to notify the driver of the need to take a break, is now standard. Automatic high beams are also standard. Additional safety features like blind spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control are optional, as is a head-up display.\n\nPricing\n\nThe 2020 Jaguar XE will go on sale in the summer with a starting price of $40,895, including a $995 destination fee (AWD adds $2,000). That price will also include a five-year/60,000-mile warranty, as well as five years or 60,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance and 24/7 roadside assistance, in addition to five years of Jaguar’s InControl Remote & Protect connected car services. The R-Dynamic S model, meanwhile, starts at $47,290 with destination.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2017 XE, Jaguar’s first small sports sedan in nearly a decade, is a dynamic car that rides exceptionally well. Warts show up in cabin materials and interior space, but it’s a worthwhile consideration nonetheless.\n\nVersus the competition: The XE isn’t the roomiest or most luxurious choice in a crowded class, but it’s among the most fun to drive.\n\nOn sale now, the Jaguar XE comes in four trim levels plus a limited-run First Edition, each with a turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline or diesel engine, or a supercharged gas V-6. Rear-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission are standard; all-wheel drive is optional with the diesel and V-6. Stack up the trim levels here.\n\nI drove rear- and all-wheel-drive XEs at Jaguar’s Colorado media preview, testing both the V-6 and the diesel four-cylinder. I had already put a V-6 XE through an autocross handling course near Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters. A caveat on ride quality: All the sedans I drove in Colorado had Jaguar’s optional adaptive suspension, the fanciest of three setups. Jaguar also offers fixed suspensions with regular or sport tuning in the XE, but I can’t comment on ride quality with either setup.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nThe Jaguar XE’s straightforward styling should age well. The nose looks like a pared-down XJ or XF, while the taillights incorporate cues from the F-Type roadster, with a clean, squared-off design. Alloy wheels range from 17 to 20 inches in diameter and the top R-Sport trim has some subtle ground effects.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nIn my initial handling course in Chicago (read my early thoughts here), the rear-drive XE with the supercharged V-6 revealed masterful dynamics. The nose tucks instantly into corners and the tail drifts free, with plenty of warning, for as long or as little as you’d like. A drive on mountain switchbacks near Aspen, Colo., proved that the XE’s all-wheel drive — which sends almost all the power to the rear wheels under normal circumstances — delivers nearly as much fun.\n\nWith the turbocharged diesel, the XE is every bit as dynamic as a BMW 3 Series or Cadillac ATS — two benchmark rivals for handling. The car rotates controllably and instantly, uphill or downhill. All-wheel drive and the supercharged V-6 give the XE its heaviest curb weight (about 200 pounds heavier than the diesel or rear-drive V-6 sedans I also drove) and it shows up in the form of soupier reflexes — chiefly, a touch slower steering turn-in and hints of understeer. Still, the chassis keeps body motions in check; even at its portliest, the XE stays flat as you accelerate, corner and brake.\n\nThe 180-horsepower, turbo-diesel four-cylinder’s robust torque — 318 pounds-feet, which is nearly as much as the supercharged V-6 — makes for gratifying low-rev acceleration, while the 340-hp, supercharged V-6 pulls with lag-free urgency. Jaguar’s eight-speed automatic is an occasional hindrance to both engines, lagging on downshifts or gear-hunting through them when you call for more power. Two sportier settings (one accessible via the gearshift itself, the other through a driving-mode selector) shore up some of the lag, but it’s just another example that high gear counts do not a good transmission make.\n\nRide quality is a high point. With the adaptive suspension and 18-inch rims, the XE takes on broken pavement, tar patches and rapid elevation changes with outstanding control. The 19s introduce a degree of chop, but even then, ride quality still shows a lot of polish.\n\nThe turbo four-cylinder gas engine that I didn’t test makes 240 hp, but Jaguar offers it only with rear-wheel drive. There’s a manual transmission available in the Jaguar XE abroad but not here, something that probably upsets me more than it does 95 percent of XE shoppers.\n\nInterior\n\nAs fun as the Jaguar XE is to drive, some will find the cabin too small or spartan. The sedan is wider than its German rivals, but the cabin feels narrow up front and skimpy on headroom all around. The short windows limit forward and rearward visibility, and the doors are an ergonomic lapse — a mishmash of outcroppings, none of them at the right position or length to be an armrest. Legroom and seat height are both adequate in back, but the limited headroom means taller passengers will have Calvin hair by trip’s end. (That’s of Watterson fame, not Coolidge or Klein.)\n\nCabin materials are impressive in certain areas, particularly with the XE’s optional vinyl-wrapped dashboard. But there’s a degree of consistency elsewhere in the class that’s lacking here. You don’t have to look hard to see where Jaguar stashed cheaper, lower-grade plastics — places the 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and other cars trim with richer materials. Some rivals have convincing faux leather in their cheaper variants, but the XE’s bottom trims have a grade of vinyl that won’t fool anyone who looks closely.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nThe standard multimedia setup includes an 8-inch touch-screen with physical shortcut keys, HD radio, a USB and iPod interface, and Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio streaming. Two Meridian premium stereos are optional, as is a 10.2-inch display that replaces the 8-inch screen and shortcut keys. Its on-screen shortcut buttons are less intuitive than the smaller screen’s physical ones, but it’s otherwise a first-rate setup, with a navigation system that allows you to pinch and swipe at smartphone speeds. The 8-inch screen also offers navigation, but it’s a slower, rudimentary system by comparison. With either screen, an optional app interface supports many third-party applications off a connected iPhone or Android smartphone, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are unavailable.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nTypical of a small sports sedan, the Jaguar XE’s cabin storage is tight. The center console won’t hold much; a nook ahead of the gearshift is good for a medium-size smartphone. Trunk space, however, is impressive. At 15.9 cubic feet, the XE rivals many midsize sedan trunks.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Jaguar XE has not been crash-tested. Jaguar offers all the expected safety technologies, but it’s expensive to actually get them. A backup camera, which is standard on many non-luxury cars, is optional on the base XE. And you can’t get forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking — an important safety feature that’s standard in the C-Class and Audi A4 — until the XE’s top trim.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPricing starts in the mid-$30,000s and extends to just south of $67,000 with all options; that spread is comparable to other sports sedans. A moonroof and power seats are standard and, if you throw in crowd-pleaser options like a backup camera and heated seats, you can get a nicely equipped Jaguar XE with rear-wheel drive and the turbo four-cylinder for roughly $37,000 — fairly affordable, as similarly equipped rivals go.\n\nThrow in Jaguar’s impressive standard warranty, which includes complimentary maintenance, and the XE is an interesting choice for driving enthusiasts, albeit less tempting if you want a bona fide luxury car or need to cart family and friends around.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Jaguar XE?\n\nThe Jaguar XE is a compact luxury sports sedan that seats up to five people. It offers several engines: a 247-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter gas four-cylinder; a 180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 296-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter gas four-cylinder; and a 380-hp, supercharged 3.0-liter gas V-6. All engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and all-wheel drive are offered. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4. The XE has been refreshed for the 2020 model year.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Jaguar XE?\n\nAll XEs now have Jaguar’s InControl Touch Pro multimedia system, which gets minor changes this year. There’s also a new Landmark Edition with special exterior and interior cues.\n\nA new high-performance XE SV Project 8 is also available. Powered by a 592-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine, the SV Project 8 is hand-built in England and can reach a top speed of 200 mph. Features include manually adjustable ride height and aerodynamics, as well as carbon-ceramic brakes. The SV Project 8 seats four, and only 300 will be built worldwide.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Jaguar XE Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors, dual-zone climate control, a 10-inch touchscreen multimedia system and Bluetooth streaming audio. Available features include power-folding side mirrors, a 40/20/40-split folding backseat, a Meridian stereo, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, navigation, a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial), lane keep assist, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Jaguar XE?\n\nXE highlights include steering feel, handling and ride comfort. The supercharged V-6 is a strong performer, too. Downsides include poor rear visibility, a snug cabin and inconsistent interior materials. You may be able to find a deal on a 2019 XE as dealers look to make room for the updated 2020 model.",
