      "expert_review": "You would think, given the Ferrari F430 Spider’s unearthly good looks — its sheet metal like a fierce, turbulent flow of molten lipstick — that the car would primarily be a visual experience. And yet, as I sit here reflecting on my week in this car, my brain trembling with San Andreas-like aftershocks and my hair fully locked in the horizontal position, what I remember most is its sound — or sounds. This thing has more voices than Linda Blair in full antichrist mode.\n\nTip up the driver’s door handle recessed in the car’s shoulder line, and from deep within come the whirring sounds of pumps and high-pressure hydraulics stirred from their slumber. Uh-oh. Something license-losing this way comes. Swing open the lightweight aluminum door, park your unworthy hinder in the cradling leather seat (upholstered like the best luggage you’ll never own), turn the red key and press the start button on the steering wheel. The big, flat-crank V8 spins with a chuffing, pneumatic cough, then lights with an icy-hot bark that swamps all other sounds in the parking deck.\n\nThe idle note is polyphonic. There’s the altogether unimpressive and tinny flatulence coming from the quad exhausts, combined with the throb of measured detonation of the 4.3-liter, 483-horsepower engine, which is that ungodly thing with the twin red nacelles under the transparent engine cover. Once the engine light on the instrument panel goes off, the oil is warm and the catalytic converters are up to temperature. It’s safe to give it the gas. Sort of.\n\nThis is not a car for the bashful. The F430 Spider is exactly as loud as four Italian sport bikes glued together, which is to say loud enough to set off jewelry-store burglar alarms and register on governmental homeland security monitors. At part-throttle, the car tries to restrain itself — it sounds a lot like a trombone played with the mute in. But as soon as the needle on the big yellow tach sweeps past 4,000 rpm, an air-metering drum rotates between the dual air plenums, and then, oh boy. This is the motorized diphthong from hell. BaaaaWHAAAAHHHH!\n\nTo double-downshift this car in a tiled tunnel is to experience utter automotive satori. The whopping, snapping overrun sounds made me choke back tears of joy. I know. I’m not well, really. If you want to help, please donate $205,000 to the Dan Neil Ferrari Fund. With research, there is hope.\n\nThe product of what is purely the most sophisticated piece of reciprocating machinery on the road, this sound is dark and primitive and triggers fight-or-flight bells in those who hear it. Tease the 8,500-rpm redline and for blocks around alfresco diners raise their heads in unison, like African meerkats around a watering hole when one picks up the scent of hyena.\n\nAnd that’s just around town. With an empty on-ramp and a clear shot at the freeway, nail the throttle and the sound you get is like pulling Odin’s beard — an unhinged, stressed-metal rage and hurricane howl of the induction pounding down air. The car rockets from 0 to 100 mph in less than 9 seconds. Keep your boot in it and crack off four 150-millisecond upshifts with the car’s F1-style paddle shifters. Just try.\n\nIn jail, no one can hear you scream.\n\nThe experiential difference between this car and the one I drove in Italy last year is, of course, the fully automatic convertible top, which stows vertically behind the seats so as not to obstruct the view of the engine. It takes 20 seconds for the electro-hydraulics to nest the top under the sculptured fairing. Truncated roof buttresses merge with the upholstered roll hoops behind the seats to provide some beveling in case the car should roll over.\n\nThis is a slick and sleek installation that takes almost nothing away from the car’s performance. As a convertible, it still feels as stiff as a submarine hatch and faster than a nuclear-tipped torpedo. And yet, with the top down, the driver can hear the car in its surrounding ambience, and it’s a completely different gestalt from the coupe, as the bellowing rip-and-tear sounds fold back on you from canyon walls.\n\nThe F430 is the best-handling car in the world. There, I’ve said it. This thing feels like it was grown from the purest of sports-car stem cells and exposed to Fantastic Four-like gamma rays. An hour’s hard driving in mountain switchbacks will exhaust your supply of sailor expletives and you will be reduced to “Gee willikers” and “Boy howdy!”\n\nFor this you could credit many things. The F1-style paddle-shifted gearbox — essentially a six-speed manual transmission with a computer managing the clutch — is superb. Even at near redline acceleration, the gearbox slips from ratio to ratio with a smoothness Napoleon brandy would envy. More important, you can drive this car deep into a corner full on the brakes, tugging the left paddle for downshifts — the F430 will expertly blip the throttle to rev-match the gears — then turn in and lift off the brakes to waggle the rear end. Trail-braking was never this easy.\n\nAt this point, the car’s electro-hydraulic differential comes in. At corner entry, the E-diff frees up the rear end to allow maximum difference in rotational speeds between the left and right rear wheels, helping the car turn. Open the throttle again at the corner apex and the E-diff — gathering data from steering, engine and inertia sensors all over the car — actually overdrives the outside rear wheel. The steering effort lightens in your hands and the car arcs around the corner like a wheeling kestrel.\n\nOf course, it has magnificent brakes, perfect steering and raw, Fujita-scale power. Lots of exotics do. The Ferrari’s advantage is that so much of it is usable. Yes, it has lateral grip in excess of .9 g’s, thanks to the enormous Bridgestones clutched in its paws. But unlike a lot of exotics, all that grip is available the instant you turn the car — no waiting for the suspension to take a set, no countering momentum while the chassis settles down. It is just there.\n\nThe F430 is the first Ferrari to be equipped with the manettino, a five-position switch that changes the behavior and thresholds of the car’s gearbox, engine management, suspension, anti-lock brakes and stability control. In the ice and low-grip settings, the traction, anti-spin and ABS functions are all set on Defcon 4 to prevent the car from getting out of control. Sport setting is “normal,” although it’s pretty dang sporty. In the race setting, the gearshift points are raised, the suspension goes hard, and the computers lie back even further, stepping in only if the car senses major trouble. True to Ferrari’s double-black-diamond ethos, expert drivers can turn all these systems off so it’s just you and the car against the rapacious weeds and ditches that would gobble you both.\n\nIt ain’t me, babe. Oh, no, no. It ain’t me.\n\nIS this a perfect car? No. At speeds below 10 mph, it tends to have a nasty driveline snatch — the car yanks back and forth, making you look really uncool. Also, the top mechanism on our megabuck test car needed a little help to latch onto the windshield header. The leather cubby between the seats resisted opening. The long and gorgeous nose of the car, carved to aerodynamic perfection, tends to scuff on anything less than bed-flat streets. I had to plan my route around Santa Monica carefully lest I leave hundreds of dollars’ worth of red paint on the concrete. And the audio system is something out of a box of Italian Cracker Jack.\n\nBut the F430 Spider is an event, a celebration. Sitting in a parking garage with ordinary cars, it inhabits another space and time. It glows like a hot isotope. Is someone in coronary arrest? Put two of these on his chest and yell, “Clear!”\n\nThe arrow has never been smithed to beat it.\n\nI spent all week giving people rides, but the best was Wylie, the 8-year-old son of an editor here at the paper. He showed up at my desk in his Ferrari polo shirt and hat, about the cutest thing that ever drew breath. I buckled him into the car and took him for a ride. He squealed and the car squealed and I poured on the gas. For the most part, he was speechless, smiling and laughing. Then, with a child’s instinct for perfect truth, he shouted over the engine and the wind: “I’m dazzled!”\n\nMe too, kid.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFerrari unveiled the successor to its 360 Modena at the 2004 Paris Motor Show. The new two-seat sports car was substantially more powerful, and is offered in both coupe and convertible form. A high-performance model called Scuderia joins the lineup for 2008, with a limited run of 250 available. In the same way that the previous 360 Modena had the Challenge Stradale performance variant, the Scuderia adds racing flavor to the F430.\n\nSeveral innovations were derived from Ferrari’s Formula One racecars. Two of them were “world firsts” for production cars: the E-Diff electronic differential, which optimizes traction, and the steering-wheel-mounted commutator switch, which controls the vehicle dynamics systems.\n\nA rear-mounted 4.3-liter V-8 generates 490 horsepower, which results in a weight-to-power ratio of 6.2 pounds per horsepower. According to Ferrari, the F430 can accelerate from zero to 62 mph in 4 seconds. For the Scuderia, zero to 62 mph happens in an estimated 3.6 seconds. The extra acceleration comes from more power — 510 hp total — and lighter weight.\n\nExterior\nLargely hand-built in Italy like other Ferraris, the F430 features an aerodynamic shape that incorporates contemporary competition technologies — specifically, a flat underbody and a large rear diffuser, which increases downforce. For Scuderia models, this diffuser has been modified for even more downforce. Upper and lower air intakes sit to the rear of each door. An enormous, nearly flat back window allows the V-8 to be seen from the outside. An optional braking system uses carbon-ceramic discs; Scuderias come with these discs standard, though the discs are larger than the standard F430’s.\n\nOften finished in traditional red and devoid of brightwork, the F430’s body barely clears the ground. Four round taillights sit high on the deck, flanking a relatively subtle spoiler. Four exhaust outlets poke out near the bottom edges.\n\nBuilt on a 102.4-inch wheelbase, the F430 measures 177.6 inches long overall, 75.7 inches wide and 47.8 inches tall. The front track width is a sizable 65.7 inches. Behind each seat in the F430 Spider convertible are long nacelles that trail into the rear deck alongside the engine’s viewing panel.\n\nInterior\nFerraris are known for snug cockpits, and the F430’s two-passenger space is no exception. There’s a red engine start button, and paddles alongside the steering wheel control the operation of the available F1 gearbox.\n\nScuderias use carbon fiber anywhere possible to make the car weigh less, including the interior, where even the driver’s seat is made of the lightweight material.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe F430 holds a 4.3-liter V-8 that develops 490 hp at 8,500 rpm and 343 pounds-feet of torque at 5,250 rpm. Either a traditional six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed sequential manual can be installed. Ferrari claims the Formula One-derived sequential gearbox cuts shift times down to 150 milliseconds.\n\nIn the Scuderia, the engine has been bumped up to 510 hp. It makes its peak power at 8,500 rpm. The only transmission offered is the F1-style sequential gearbox, which has been improved for even faster shifts than the regular F430’s transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFerrari’s F430 sports car is a two-seat, mid-engine coupe or roadster with a high-revving V-8 engine. The most elite F430 variant is the track-special Scuderia, which joined the lineup for 2008. Competition comes from exotics like the 2009 Porsche 911 GT2.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Ferrari Scuderia)\n\nExterior\nLargely hand-built in Italy, like other Ferraris, the F430 features an aerodynamic shape that incorporates contemporary competition technologies — specifically, a flat underbody and a large rear diffuser, which increase downforce.\n\nPersonalization program offers 16 exterior colors\nUpper and lower air intakes sit to the rear of each door\nEnormous, nearly flat back window allows V-8 to be seen from the outside\nBody barely clears the ground\nFour round taillights sit high on the deck, flanking a relatively subtle spoiler\nFour exhaust outlets\nLong nacelles behind seats in convertible trail into the rear deck, alongside the engine’s viewing panel\n\nInterior\nFerraris are known for snug cockpits, and the F430’s two-passenger space is no exception. There’s a red engine-start button and, on F1 models, paddles control the operation of the automatic gearbox.\n\nInterior can be customized with carbon fiber or aluminum inserts\nAdditional storage behind seats\nPersonalization program offers 12 leather colors and eight carpet colors\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe F430 holds a 4.3-liter V-8 that develops 490 horsepower at 8,500 rpm and 342 pounds-feet of torque at 5,250 rpm. Either a traditional six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed sequential manual can be installed. Ferrari says the Formula One-derived sequential gearbox cuts shift times down to 150 milliseconds.\n\nE-Diff electronic differential optimizes traction\nSteering-wheel-mounted commutator switch controls vehicle dynamics systems\nFerrari-sourced zero-to-62-mph time of 4 seconds; 3.6 seconds in Scuderia\nOptional braking system uses carbon-ceramic discs\n\nSafety\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control\n\nFerrari Scuderia\nThe F430’s predecessor, the 360 Modena, had a high-performance, track-ready version named Challenge Stradale. The F430’s version of that track package is the Scuderia.\n\nDiffuser modified for additional downforce\nScuderia uses carbon fiber everywhere possible to lessen weight, including the driver’s seat\nScuderia bumps power to 503 hp at 8,500 rpm and is only available with the F1-style sequential gearbox, which has been improved for even faster shifts than the regular F430’s transmission\nLarger brakes with carbon-ceramic discs\nBack to top",
