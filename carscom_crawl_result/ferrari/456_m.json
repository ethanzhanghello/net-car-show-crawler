      "expert_review": "The best thing about this job? That’s easy. It’s the day they hand you the keys to a new Ferrari.\n\nIt came recently when Ferrari of North America’s Carlo Fiorani invited me to drive the new 456M GTA touring coupe at Ferrari of San Francisco, located in this Marin County bedroom community.\n\nI’ve driven a Lamborghini and a Rolls-Royce and a turbo Porsche, as well as a few one-of-a-kind concept cars.\n\nBut an auto writer who has never driven a Ferrari, well, that leaves a very fast, very Italian hole in the driving resume. Now, I’ve filled that hole.\n\nThere’s something special about a Ferrari. In my mind, these are red racing cars bred in Italy to accentuate one trait: speed. At a time when auto-making is engulfed in merger mania, where a Jaguar is a Ford and a Rover is a BMW and a Chrysler is a Mercedes, the Ferrari name remains timeless. Even in death, the guiding hand of Enzo Ferrari steers the company toward checkered flags. It’s still about red racing cars that go very, very fast.\n\nUnfortunately, my time in a Ferrari went by very fast, too. I only had about 30 minutes, most of it in the congested area around Mill Valley and San Rafael. So I traveled north on 101, stopped at a fairly straight, mostly abandoned street I knew about for a few quick starts and stops, and then headed back to the dealership.\n\nYet, the drive was enlightening. The car was a wonderful combination of power and speed. I never got the car anywhere near triple-digit fast. To be able to drive it in the desert or on a race track would really be an enticing prospect. Still, it was easy to feel the never-ending power of the engine and the tightness of the build.\n\nThe 456M GTA is Ferrari’s family car. Some have even derided it because, they say, a Ferrari with a back seat just isn’t a real Ferrari. They say the same about the automatic transmission (that’s the A in the GTA). A manually shifting GT model 456M is also available.\n\nYet, Ferrari’s 2plus2 roots go back to 1948 when it introduced a four-seat model at the Turin auto show. In fact, according to Ferrari spokesman Fiorani, 2plus2 sales have accounted for about 20 percent of total Ferrari production over the past 50 years.\n\nNone has been more successful than the 456, which has sold nearly 2,000 units since it arrived in late 1993.\n\n“The customer for the 456 is a special customer,” said Fiorani. “They need room for family or friends.”\n\nIt for the business owner who wants to take three employees or three customers to lunch. Or for the entrepreneur who picks up his kid and a friend from a soccer game. They are men (95 percent) who make a lot of money ($210,000).\n\nThere’s no doubt that a Ferrari is all about speed. Let’s look at the numbers. A 436-horsepower, 5.5-liter, front-mounted V-12 engine rockets this car from a standing stop to beyond the speed limit in 5.1 seconds. It takes only 13.4 seconds to reach a quarter mile and about a half minute (33.4 se conds) to go one mile. Its top speed is over 186 mph.\n\nThe M designation means “modified,” which means that this new version is a change from the original 1993 456. Changes include a new engine management system, a carbon-fiber hood, a new grille, new seats and a new fixed rear wing.\n\nNone of that mattered much to me, as I’d never driven this model or any Ferrari before.\n\nMy only disappointment was that this car wasn’t Ferrari red. In my mind, all the great cars of Enzo Ferrari were painted red. Instead, it was a subtle silver.\n\nThe exterior shape is elegant, classic — designed by long-time Ferrari stylist Pininfarina — but it doesn’t convey Ferrari the way that a F-50 or even a 550 Maranello does. This car looks more familiar — say a touch of Porsche here, a bit of vintage Jag there — than truly unique. Still, there’s something about the prancing horse on the grille that turns heads.\n\nThe 456M’s interior is truly a wonder. The seats were covered in C olly leather, rich looking and race-car stiff. Behind the three-spoke, leather-covered wheel with the prancing horse logo in the center were two round dials containing a 10,000 RPM tachometer and a 340-kilometer per hour speedometer. The chrome shifter was both ornamental and functional.\n\nIf you think of a Ferrari as a throwback, as a raw racer, you would be surprised to find air conditioning, power everything (windows, steering, seats, doors) and a great stereo system.\n\nAt $225,000, this Ferrari was the most expensive car I’ve ever driven. Perhaps I’m a bit jaded, but it was the fact of being inside a Ferrari, and not that it was a quarter-million dollar Ferrari, that impressed me. What other car merits a cover story on Smithsonian magazine (“The Ferrari Mystique,” December 1997)? After my first small dose of the mystique, I only want more.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nUnchanged for 2002, Ferraris only 2+2 model has front bucket seats and a small, two-place backseat. Ferrari calls its 456M GT/GTA a berlinetta  which means little sedan in Italian  but the sports car is also referred to as a coupe. As the company has explained, the 456M GT/GTA is the evolution of a very popular concept amongst Ferrari clients who want a real Ferrari with the practicality of rear seats for two additional passengers. The 2+2 models are intended to deliver saloon-class comfort and roominess combined with class-leading performance.\n\nIn contrast to the 360 Modena  Ferraris least costly model, which is equipped with a V-8 behind the seats  the 456M GT/GTA has a front-mounted V-12 engine that generates 442 horsepower. A six-speed-manual transmission goes into the 456M GT, while a five-speed automatic is used in the 456M GTA. Introduced in 1992, these two cars have been the most expensive Ferrari models sold in the United States.\n\nThe M in its model designation signifies modifications made in 1998, which include improved aerodynamics. Rear bumpers incorporate a lower fixed wing to enhance downforce provided by the flat, rear underbody and diffuser. In 2001, Ferrari sold a total of 1,200 cars in the United States, according to Automotive News.\n\nExterior\nLike other Ferrari models, the 456M GT/GTA was styled by Pininfarina, a legendary Italian design studio thats been responsible for many illustrious models in the companys history. Body lines are softer than those of other Ferrari models, coupled with a crosshatch grille and large bodyside scallops. The cars classic look is accentuated by its long-hood/short-deck profile. Body panels are constructed of aluminum, the chassis is made of steel, and the hood is carbon fiber.\n\nMeasuring about a foot longer than the 360 Modena, the 456M GT/GTA comes in at 187.5 inches long overall on a 102.4-inch wheelbase. It stands 51.2 inches tall, and the tires are 17 inches in diameter.\n\nInterior\nLeather upholstery is standard in the 456M GT/GTA. Ferrari fanciers are accustomed to sitting in snug bucket seats, held securely and ready to enjoy a spirited driving experience  even if that experience happens to take place on a crowded urban expressway. Gaining access to the backseat is made easier because the front passenger seat automatically slides forward when its backrest is tilted. But dont expect an abundance of space back there.\n\nMinor gauges are positioned atop the transmission tunnel and angled toward the driver. Standard air conditioning incorporates a solar sensor.\n\nUnder the Hood\nDeveloping 442 hp at 6,250 rpm and 406 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm, the 5.5-liter V-12 is the same size as the engine installed in the 550 Maranello, which is being transformed into a 575M Maranello with a larger V-12. Although the engine sizes are the same in the 456M GT/GTA and 550 Maranello, the V-12 in the 456M GT/GTA is less powerful. A six-speed-manual gearbox goes into the GT model, and the 456M GTA gets a five-speed-automatic transmission that was developed specifically for this installation. The manual transmission is in a unit with the ZF limited-slip rear differential. Ferrari claims that the 456M GT accelerates from zero to 62 mph in 5.1 seconds, while the 456M GTA performs that task in 5.4 seconds.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 3/27/02",
