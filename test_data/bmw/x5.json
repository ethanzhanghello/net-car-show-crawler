These automated driving and parking systems support the driver or lighten their workload in a wide variety of situations. They do so by processing camera images as well as the data gathered by ultrasonic and radar sensors to monitor the vehicle's surroundings, to warn of potential hazards, and to minimise the risk of an accident with corrective braking or steering inputs. In addition to this, an advanced system of sensors and intelligent vehicle control also enables greater automated manoeuvring capabilities.",

With automatic Speed Limit Assist, traffic light recognition (depending on the market), route speed control and Active Navigation also included, speed and steering movements in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 can be adapted with remarkable precision to the current traffic situation, the distance to vehicles ahead, speed limits, overtaking restrictions, traffic light signals and the nature of the route being followed. Corrective steering inputs help the driver to keep the vehicle in the lane detected by the system or change lane when necessary. The system's hands-on-wheel detection is very sensitive and recognises contact even when only a few fingers briefly touch the wheel. The Emergency Stop Assistant and Active Lane Change and Merging Assistant can now likewise be found in the extended repertoire of Driving Assistant Professional functions.",

As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",

              "In addition to this, the Manoeuvre Assistant now included in the Parking Assistant Professional package is able to store far more complex manoeuvres using GPS data and the trajectory data from steering movements, and subsequently perform them as an automated routine. As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",
              "Drivers have the choice of controlling both the automated parking functionality and the Manoeuvre Assistant's actions either from inside the vehicle or remotely using their Apple iPhone. It is also possible to quickly switch between the two modes, meaning that once an automated parking or general manoeuvre has commenced, it can be halted at any time and then resumed again from inside the car using its control/operation system or from outside using a smartphone.",
              "The BMW Drive Recorder is another feature of Parking Assistant Professional and uses the driver assistance systems' cameras to record video images all around the vehicle, so these can be stored and later either played back on the control display when the vehicle is stationary or exported via the USB interface. If the vehicle is stolen, the anti-theft recorder sends a message to the customer's smartphone. The customer can then access and store the videos recorded by the cameras at the front and rear of the new BMW X5 or BMW X6 and on the exterior mirrors.",

Naturally formulated spoken instructions can now be used to adjust the air conditioning, open a window or operate the panoramic glass roof, for instance. Various functions of the driver assistance systems in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 can likewise be voice controlled. An instant text display also now indicates the command that has just been understood and processed by the voice assistant. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is additionally capable of recognising user behaviour and proactively making suggestions to the driver on how the vehicle can best be used.",

              "The arrival time is calculated using an anticipatory method which factors in the usual traffic levels along the entire route. With Connected Parking, BMW Maps is also able to provide assistance when searching for a parking space close to the final destination. The adaptive navigation system now recognises places that are driven to frequently and proactively notifies the driver if the traffic on the memorised route is much busier than normal.",
              "The My BMW App acts as a universal digital interface, providing information on the vehicle's status and available range at any time. And it enables remote operation of functions such as vehicle locating, locking and unlocking the doors and monitoring the car's immediate vicinity. Meanwhile, the Remote 3D View function gives drivers the ability to call up a three-dimensional live image of their vehicle and its immediate vicinity on their smartphone. They can select various different views of the car and its surroundings."

              "The electric motor integrated into the eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission on the new BMW X5 xDrive50e boasts a substantial increase in power output and a BMW-patented innovation for boosting torque delivery. With a power density in excess of 5.0 kW/kg, the new synchronous motor produces a nominal output of 145 kW/197 hp (+62 kW/84 hp) while the upper limit of its rev range has been raised to 11,500 rpm. A pre-gearing stage is additionally used to increase the effective torque produced by the electric motor to a maximum 450 Nm (332 lb-ft) at the transmission input for the motor. In this way, the compact electric motor is able to provide the sort of torque boost that could normally only be achieved using a far larger and heavier unit. The improved build-up of power resulting from the pre-gearing stage between the electric motor's rotor and the transmission's input shaft makes a clear difference both when accelerating off the line and when putting in a quick burst of speed. The new BMW X5 xDrive50e needs just 4.8 seconds to race to 100 km/h (62 mph) from rest.",

As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",

              "Comfort and safety in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 are elevated to another new level by a significantly expanded selection of standard and optional driver assistance systems. These automated driving and parking systems support the driver or lighten their workload in a wide variety of situations. They do so by processing camera images as well as the data gathered by ultrasonic and radar sensors to monitor the vehicle's surroundings, to warn of potential hazards, and to minimise the risk of an accident with corrective braking or steering inputs. In addition to this, an advanced system of sensors and intelligent vehicle control also enables greater automated manoeuvring capabilities.",
              "The standard front-collision warning system is now also capable of detecting oncoming traffic when turning left (in countries where vehicles drive on the right) as well as pedestrians or cyclists when turning right. The Evasion Assistant and Crossroads Warning likewise form part of the standard equipment roster for the new BMW X5 and BMW X6.",
              "The Lane Change Warning system - one of the components of the optional Driving Assistant - now also includes active lane return, while the package's rear crossing traffic warning feature has likewise been upgraded by the addition of braking and exit warning functions. If the Driving Assistant is specified, Lane Departure Warning now also reacts to oncoming traffic when there is a potential risk of collision.",
              "Driving Assistant Professional delivers a broad-based experience of automated driving",
              "The optional Driving Assistant Professional opens the door to an extensive automated driving experience with a combination of Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function and the Steering and Lane Control Assistant. With automatic Speed Limit Assist, traffic light recognition (depending on the market), route speed control and Active Navigation also included, speed and steering movements in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 can be adapted with remarkable precision to the current traffic situation, the distance to vehicles ahead, speed limits, overtaking restrictions, traffic light signals and the nature of the route being followed. Corrective steering inputs help the driver to keep the vehicle in the lane detected by the system or change lane when necessary. The system's hands-on-wheel detection is very sensitive and recognises contact even when only a few fingers briefly touch the wheel. The Emergency Stop Assistant and Active Lane Change and Merging Assistant can now likewise be found in the extended repertoire of Driving Assistant Professional functions.",
              "In North American markets, the Steering and Lane Control Assistant also lets the driver permanently take their hands off the steering wheel when driving on highways or other roads with structurally separated carriageways at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph). They must, however, always be in a position to assume responsibility for steering again.",
              "Parking Assistant Professional: enter and exit spaces by smartphone",
              "Drivers also benefit from even greater assistance when parking and manoeuvring. Standard specification includes the Reversing Assist Camera. And the Parking Assistant also fitted as standard in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 has been extended to include drive-off monitoring and the Trailer Assistant. The Parking Assistant helps the driver to select and park in spaces either parallel or perpendicular to the road. Instead of just using other vehicles as a guide for doing this, the system is now also able to take its bearings from any road markings and the kerb. As well as the necessary steering inputs, it is able to carry out the acceleration, braking and gear changes required for the manoeuvre both when entering and exiting spaces.",
              "The standard Reversing Assistant offers the option of automated reversing in confined spaces or situations where the driver does not have a clear view, such as multi-storey car parks or the driveways of properties. To do this, it stores the steering movements for any section the car has just driven forward through at no more than 36 km/h (22 mph). The system is then able to reverse the vehicle for distances of up to 50 metres by steering it back along the same line.",
              "On models fitted with the optional Parking Assistant Professional, the Reversing Assistant is able to store steering movements for distances of up to 200 metres and then reproduce them in reverse. Added to which, the functionality of the Reversing Assist Camera now also includes a panorama view for the vehicle on the control display. Selecting this option greatly expands the automated parking abilities of the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 too. For instance, drivers also have the ability to control manoeuvres into and out of particularly tight parking spaces from outside the vehicle using the My BMW App on their smartphone (available for Apple iPhones with operating system iOS 16.2 or later).",
              "In addition to this, the Manoeuvre Assistant now included in the Parking Assistant Professional package is able to store far more complex manoeuvres using GPS data and the trajectory data from steering movements, and subsequently perform them as an automated routine. As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",
              "Drivers have the choice of controlling both the automated parking functionality and the Manoeuvre Assistant's actions either from inside the vehicle or remotely using their Apple iPhone. It is also possible to quickly switch between the two modes, meaning that once an automated parking or general manoeuvre has commenced, it can be halted at any time and then resumed again from inside the car using its control/operation system or from outside using a smartphone.",
              "The BMW Drive Recorder is another feature of Parking Assistant Professional and uses the driver assistance systems' cameras to record video images all around the vehicle, so these can be stored and later either played back on the control display when the vehicle is stationary or exported via the USB interface. If the vehicle is stolen, the anti-theft recorder sends a message to the customer's smartphone. The customer can then access and store the videos recorded by the cameras at the front and rear of the new BMW X5 or BMW X6 and on the exterior mirrors.",

Naturally formulated spoken instructions can now be used to adjust the air conditioning, open a window or operate the panoramic glass roof, for instance. Various functions of the driver assistance systems in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 can likewise be voice controlled. An instant text display also now indicates the command that has just been understood and processed by the voice assistant. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is additionally capable of recognising user behaviour and proactively making suggestions to the driver on how the vehicle can best be used.",
              "When the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is in use, new graphics appear in the displays to emphasise the system's interactive character. The graphic \"turns\" towards the speaker, thereby visualising how the system is listening attentively to what is being said.",
              "The arrival time is calculated using an anticipatory method which factors in the usual traffic levels along the entire route. With Connected Parking, BMW Maps is also able to provide assistance when searching for a parking space close to the final destination. The adaptive navigation system now recognises places that are driven to frequently and proactively notifies the driver if the traffic on the memorised route is much busier than normal.",
              "The My BMW App acts as a universal digital interface, providing information on the vehicle's status and available range at any time. And it enables remote operation of functions such as vehicle locating, locking and unlocking the doors and monitoring the car's immediate vicinity. Meanwhile, the Remote 3D View function gives drivers the ability to call up a three-dimensional live image of their vehicle and its immediate vicinity on their smartphone.

As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",

              "Drivers also benefit from even greater assistance when parking and manoeuvring. Standard specification includes the Reversing Assist Camera. And the Parking Assistant also fitted as standard in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 has been extended to include drive-off monitoring and the Trailer Assistant. The Parking Assistant helps the driver to select and park in spaces either parallel or perpendicular to the road. Instead of just using other vehicles as a guide for doing this, the system is now also able to take its bearings from any road markings and the kerb. As well as the necessary steering inputs, it is able to carry out the acceleration, braking and gear changes required for the manoeuvre both when entering and exiting spaces.",
              "The standard Reversing Assistant offers the option of automated reversing in confined spaces or situations where the driver does not have a clear view, such as multi-storey car parks or the driveways of properties. To do this, it stores the steering movements for any section the car has just driven forward through at no more than 36 km/h (22 mph). The system is then able to reverse the vehicle for distances of up to 50 metres by steering it back along the same line.",
              "On models fitted with the optional Parking Assistant Professional, the Reversing Assistant is able to store steering movements for distances of up to 200 metres and then reproduce them in reverse. Added to which, the functionality of the Reversing Assist Camera now also includes a panorama view for the vehicle on the control display. Selecting this option greatly expands the automated parking abilities of the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 too. For instance, drivers also have the ability to control manoeuvres into and out of particularly tight parking spaces from outside the vehicle using the My BMW App on their smartphone (available for Apple iPhones with operating system iOS 16.2 or later).",
              "In addition to this, the Manoeuvre Assistant now included in the Parking Assistant Professional package is able to store far more complex manoeuvres using GPS data and the trajectory data from steering movements, and subsequently perform them as an automated routine. As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",
              "Drivers have the choice of controlling both the automated parking functionality and the Manoeuvre Assistant's actions either from inside the vehicle or remotely using their Apple iPhone. It is also possible to quickly switch between the two modes, meaning that once an automated parking or general manoeuvre has commenced, it can be halted at any time and then resumed again from inside the car using its control/operation system or from outside using a smartphone.",
              "The BMW Drive Recorder is another feature of Parking Assistant Professional and uses the driver assistance systems' cameras to record video images all around the vehicle, so these can be stored and later either played back on the control display when the vehicle is stationary or exported via the USB interface. If the vehicle is stolen, the anti-theft recorder sends a message to the customer's smartphone. The customer can then access and store the videos recorded by the cameras at the front and rear of the new BMW X5 or BMW X6 and on the exterior mirrors.",

Various functions of the driver assistance systems in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 can likewise be voice controlled. An instant text display also now indicates the command that has just been understood and processed by the voice assistant. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is additionally capable of recognising user behaviour and proactively making suggestions to the driver on how the vehicle can best be used.",

              "The arrival time is calculated using an anticipatory method which factors in the usual traffic levels along the entire route. With Connected Parking, BMW Maps is also able to provide assistance when searching for a parking space close to the final destination. The adaptive navigation system now recognises places that are driven to frequently and proactively notifies the driver if the traffic on the memorised route is much busier than normal.",
              "The My BMW App acts as a universal digital interface, providing information on the vehicle's status and available range at any time. And it enables remote operation of functions such as vehicle locating, locking and unlocking the doors and monitoring the car's immediate vicinity. Meanwhile, the Remote 3D View function gives drivers the ability to call up a three-dimensional live image of their vehicle and its immediate vicinity on their smartphone.

As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",

These automated driving and parking systems support the driver or lighten their workload in a wide variety of situations. They do so by processing camera images as well as the data gathered by ultrasonic and radar sensors to monitor the vehicle's surroundings, to warn of potential hazards, and to minimise the risk of an accident with corrective braking or steering inputs. In addition to this, an advanced system of sensors and intelligent vehicle control also enables greater automated manoeuvring capabilities.",

With automatic Speed Limit Assist, traffic light recognition (depending on the market), route speed control and Active Navigation also included, speed and steering movements in the new BMW X5 and BMW X6 can be adapted with remarkable precision to the current traffic situation, the distance to vehicles ahead, speed limits, overtaking restrictions, traffic light signals and the nature of the route being followed. Corrective steering inputs help the driver to keep the vehicle in the lane detected by the system or change lane when necessary. The system's hands-on-wheel detection is very sensitive and recognises contact even when only a few fingers briefly touch the wheel. The Emergency Stop Assistant and Active Lane Change and Merging Assistant can now likewise be found in the extended repertoire of Driving Assistant Professional functions.",

As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",

If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",
              "Drivers have the choice of controlling both the automated parking functionality and the Manoeuvre Assistant's actions either from inside the vehicle or remotely using their Apple iPhone. It is also possible to quickly switch between the two modes, meaning that once an automated parking or general manoeuvre has commenced, it can be halted at any time and then resumed again from inside the car using its control/operation system or from outside using a smartphone.",
              "The BMW Drive Recorder is another feature of Parking Assistant Professional and uses the driver assistance systems' cameras to record video images all around the vehicle, so these can be stored and later either played back on the control display when the vehicle is stationary or exported via the USB interface. If the vehicle is stolen, the anti-theft recorder sends a message to the customer's smartphone.

With Connected Parking, BMW Maps is also able to provide assistance when searching for a parking space close to the final destination. The adaptive navigation system now recognises places that are driven to frequently and proactively notifies the driver if the traffic on the memorised route is much busier than normal.",

All combustion engines in the range are now combined with a new eightspeed Steptronic Sport transmission housing an electric motor in its compact housing. This generates an output boost of up to 9 kW/12 hp and 200 Nm (147 lb-ft) of torque, helping the engine to deliver a smooth, dynamic drive along with high efficiency. What is more, the mild hybrid system can additionally be used for driving purely on electric power at very low speeds in the BMW X5 xDrive40i and BMW X6 xDrive40i models. The electric motor has the additional effect of enabling smoother operation of both the Automatic Start/Stop function and the coasting function that comes into play when the Driving Experience Control mode ECO PRO is selected.",
              "The energy required for the electric power boost is stored in a 48V battery located in the engine compartment. It is charged extremely efficiently during overrun and braking phases by means of adaptive recuperation and also feeds the regenerated energy to the vehicle's electrical system.",
              "The range-topping BMW X5 M60i xDrive and BMW X6 M60i xDrive models are both powered by a newly developed V8 petrol engine. The 4.4-litre power unit can trace its genes back to engines used in renowned BMW M and racing machines and utilises the thermodynamic benefits of a cross-bank exhaust manifold, bank-symmetrical turbochargers and external engine oil cooling. In addition, a reinforced crankshaft drive, further developed turbocharging with a blow-off valve, a new oil pump and a weight-minimised oil sump all play their part in increasing the engine's efficiency. The engine teams up with the 48V mild hybrid technology to also produce noticeably superior response and power delivery under acceleration.",
              "The drive system in the duo of BMW M models generates maximum output of 390 kW/530 hp and peak torque of 750 Nm (553 lb-ft). It propels the new BMW X5 M60i xDrive and new BMW X6 M60i xDrive from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds. Here, the vivacious power development of the V8 engine is accompanied by an emotionally rich soundtrack from the standard-fitted M Sport exhaust system.",

As many as ten manoeuvres at different locations, covering a distance of up to 200 metres each and a combined total of 600 metres, can be recorded. When the vehicle next arrives at a memorised starting point, the Manoeuvre Assistant will be able to carry out all the tasks required to complete the manoeuvre, controlling the accelerator, brakes and steering as well as changing gear to move forward or reverse. If necessary, the car can switch between the two directions of travel repeatedly while carrying out all the gear changes and steering inputs, for example when negotiating its way through a parking garage with little space and sharp corners. While the automated manoeuvre is in progress, the driver can focus on monitoring the vehicle's surroundings.",
